    <h1>The Pine A64 is about to become the cheapest ARM 64-bit platform to run Docker</h1>
    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 25, 2016</span>
    

<p>Yesterday one of the more promising <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pine64/pine-a64-first-15-64-bit-single-board-super-comput">Kickstarter campaigns</a>
that picked our curiosity ended after 44 days and was able to raise 1.7 million dollars.
It was a campaign to fund the cheapest 64-bit ARM board that can currently be bought for money.</p>

<p>The Pine A64 sells for 15 bucks. So why is that noteworthy when there are boards like the Pi Zero that sell for $5?</p>

<p>It very much is, when you put that price into perspective. The cheapest 64-bit ARM board we knew before the Pine was
the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1313/post/getting-docker-running-on-a-highend-arm-gaming-console-for-fun-and-profit/">NVIDIA ShieldTV</a>, which sells for about $200.
Next comes the much more expensive <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/amd-starts-shipping-seattle-arm-server-chips-14423259/">AMD Opteron A1100 series</a> where an individual chip alone starts with a price tag of $150.</p>

<p>All in all that means that the Pine A64 is the most affordable way to lay your hands on real 64-bit ARM hardware - and that by a long shot!
So what can you actually do with such a device?</p>

<p>Lots of things of course, but for us at Hypriot, the first thing we think about is: Can we run Docker on it?
And the short answer is: probably yes. But more about that later.</p>

<h3 id="the-hardware:61f50ba4cfb0b86ed4315ef6497b345f">The Hardware</h3>

<p>Before we deep dive into the nitty gritty details, let&rsquo;s first take a step back and see what the Pine A64 has to offer hardware-wise.</p>

<p>The Pine A64 does have</p>

<ul>
<li>a quad-core Cortex A53 CPU with 1,2 Ghz</li>
<li>a 64-bit processor architecture</li>
<li>up to 2 GB of DDR3 memory</li>
<li>a version with Gigabit networking</li>
<li>the ability to play 4K video</li>
</ul>

<p>What excites us the most here, is the 64-bit architecture combined with 2 GB of memory and gigabit networking.</p>

<p>Those specs set the Pine A64 distinctly apart from the Raspberry Pi 2, which much to our regret only has 100 megabit networking.
Just be aware that you&rsquo;ll get these specs only with the high-end version of the Pine. It is called the A64+ and costs a bit more with $19 (1 GB version) or $29 (2 GB version).
<strong>Even at $19 for the 1 GB version that&rsquo;s nearly half of the price of a Raspberry Pi 2.</strong></p>

<p>If it turns out that the build quality and support of the board is on par with that of the Raspberry Pi that could indeed considered an impressive accomplishment.</p>

<p>Seeing is believing and as such we prepared a couple of photos that we made from our own Pine A64+ board with 1 GB.</p>

<p>TODO: Image Gallery</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to secure an early developer version of the device, which arrived a couple of days ago.</p>

<h3 id="the-software:61f50ba4cfb0b86ed4315ef6497b345f">The Software</h3>

<p>One of the current limitations of the Pine A64 is that it only runs with Android.
The Pine makers assured us that Linux support will come, too. Still for us it is a tad annoying that Android is first instead of Linux.</p>

<p>Impatient as we are, once we got the device, we immediately started out to rectify this by getting HypriotOS to run on it.
Relatively soon it became obvious that this would not be an easy task.</p>

<p>Why? Well, the relationship between <a href="http://www.allwinnertech.com/index.html">Allwinner Technology</a> and the Open-Source community seems not always been the best.
Despite that, there exists a <a href="http://linux-sunxi.org/">very friendly and supportive Open-Source community</a> for the Allwinner related SoC&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>With the help of <a href="https://github.com/apritzel">Andre Przywara</a>(apritzel) and <a href="https://github.com/ssvb">Siarhei Siamashka</a>(ssvb) we were able to figure out how to get a basic HypriotOS booting.
This is still absolute alpha quality and lacks many important features such as networking or USB support.</p>

<p>To allow more people to join our efforts early on we did publish what we currently have in a <a href="https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-pine-a64">HypriotOS Pine A64 repository</a>.
Based on this repository our plan is to incrementally improve it until we have a fully working HypriotOS.</p>

<h3 id="the-journey:61f50ba4cfb0b86ed4315ef6497b345f">The Journey</h3>

<p>The rest of this blog post describes our preliminary journey to create Linux &amp; Docker bliss for the Pine A64.
And consider yourself sufficiently warned - this journey is not for the faint of heart&hellip; :)</p>

<h4 id="getting-started-a-magic-dwells-in-each-beginning:61f50ba4cfb0b86ed4315ef6497b345f">Getting started: a magic dwells in each beginning</h4>

<ul>
<li>How to power on the device</li>
<li>How to connect UART serial console</li>
<li>Download and flash Andre&rsquo;s SD card image</li>
<li>Include a basic HypriotOS rootfs for ARM64</li>
<li>Boot image and connect to UART0 console</li>
</ul>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get our hands on this new beauty. First to know is how you can power the Pine A64 board.
It has a standard microUSB port which you can use with a power adapter of 5V/2A. That&rsquo;s the same you might use for a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>For our first low-level testing of the board we prefer to connect to the UART0 console via an UART-to-USB connector cable.
We recommend to use one such as the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/954">USB to TTL Serial Cable</a> from Adafruit.
Adafruit also has a <a href="(https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-5-using-a-console-cable">great tutorial</a>) on how to install the drivers for such a cable on different operating systems.</p>

<p>For connecting via UART0 to the Pine there are basically two ways. Either via the pins of the <code>Euler bus</code> or via the <code>EXT</code> connectors.
The location of each can be seen on the following images. Consult the <a href="http://linux-sunxi.org/Pine64#Serial_port_.2F_UART">Linux-sunxi Wiki: Serial port / UART</a> for more details.</p>

<p>TODO: include picture here &ldquo;pine UART0 Euler bus&rdquo;</p>

<p>TODO: include picture here &ldquo;pine UART0 EXT&rdquo;</p>

<p>To actually work with the UART0 console you have to connect the UART-to-USB cable to your Linux or Mac computer and start your preferred terminal program.</p>

<p>Here is the command for Mac OS X:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo screen /dev/cu.usbserial 115200
</code></pre>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised that there is absolutely no sign of booting on your console screen when you connect the UART-to-USB cable to the Pine.
The only thing you will see is that the power LED on the board has turned green.</p>

<p>This is due to the fact that the A64 SOC is reading it&rsquo;s initial bootloader from the microSD card into memory and starts it.
This among other things initializes the UART0 port and prints out the first boot messages.</p>

<p>There might be two reasons if your Pine stays silent: either there is no SD card present or there is no working bootloader program found on the SD card.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s make sure that we have both.</p>

<p>Grab a working SD card and and flash an appropriate image on it.
Thanks to Andre Przywara there already exists <a href="https://github.com/apritzel/pine64">a first experimental Linux image</a> that we can use.</p>

<pre><code># replace sdx with the name of your SD card device file

$ xzcat pine64_linux-xxxxx.img.xz | dd of=/dev/sdx bs=1M
$ sync
</code></pre>

<p>This SD card image is a hybrid that combines components from the original Pine 64 Android image with a recent Linux 4.4.0-rc8 kernel and initrd.
All this is more or less just cobbled together to get a first prototypical SD card image with Linux running.</p>

<p>As this image does not include a full root file system one of the first ideas that came to our mind was to include our HypriotOS root filesystem for ARM64.
Alright, lets see if this really works.</p>

<p>Inserting the SD card into the Pine A64 and booting produced the expected boot messages.
After some seconds the following boot Linux prompt was visible:</p>

<pre><code>BusyBox v1.22.1 (Debian 1:1.22.0-9+deb8u1) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

/ #
/ #
/ #
/ # uname -a

devtmpfs                381.8M         0    381.8M   0% /dev
/ #
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, that was the first step, but now we would like to see, if it&rsquo;s really possible to boot into a HypriotOS root filesytem.
So let&rsquo;s reboot the Pine. As soon as the U-Boot messages apprear hit a random key tostop the automatic boot process.
This drops us into into an interactive U-Boot prompt.</p>

<p>Next we just have to follow Andre&rsquo;s documentation and tell U-Boot to boot into the root filesystem on /dev/sda10 which contains our <a href="https://github.com/hypriot/os-rootfs/releases/download/v0.6.0/rootfs-arm64.tar.gz">generic HypriotOS for ARM64</a>:</p>

<pre><code>sunxi# run load_env
sunxi# run load_dtb
sunxi# run set_cmdline
sunxi# setenv kernel_part mainline
sunxi# run load_kernel
sunxi# run boot_kernel
</code></pre>

<p>Bingo! It works.</p>

<p>Here are a few snippets of the boot log from the UART0 console.
We have stored the complete bootlog for you as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/DieterReuter/93a5d10dae6a62911b71">GitHub gist</a>.</p>

<p>Success! The first boot of HypriotOS/arm64 on a Pine A64 board.</p>

<p>But wait, this is really bleeding edge and nothing for use in production.
But is shows clearly, we can expect Linux will run sooner or later on the cheap and powerful Pine A64 boards.</p>

<h4 id="down-the-rabbit-hole-booting-the-pine-a64-into-fel-mode:61f50ba4cfb0b86ed4315ef6497b345f">Down the rabbit hole: booting the Pine A64 into FEL mode</h4>

<p>How do you start hacking on a device that does not have proper support for Linux yet?</p>

<p>Basically the first step is to find out how the stuff works that comes preinstalled.
Fortunately all Allwinner devices have a low-level subroutine in the Boot ROM that can be used as a nifty tool to gather valuable first insights.
This subroutine is called <a href="http://linux-sunxi.org/FEL">FEL</a>.</p>

<p>Besides gathering intel FEL has another useful application. It allows you to directly boot images via an USB cable from your development devices.
As such it makes the annoying process of flashing and inserting SD cards over and over again absolete.</p>

<p>Booting the Pine A64 into FEL mode is also really easy. Just leave the SD card slot empty and connect an appropriate USB cable between the Pine A64 and your host computer.
Then power on the Pine. It&rsquo;s important to know that you have to connect to the Pine with a special USB cable to the upper USB port.
That is because only this USB port is wired for using the FEL signals.</p>

<p>TODO: include picture here &ldquo;pine upper USB port&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can buy such a special USB A-male/A-male cable at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-1-5-Feet-24AWG-Plated-105441/dp/B009GUXG92">Amazon</a> or you can build <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Male-to-Male-A-to-A-USB-Cable/">your own</a>.
Once the Pine A64 is booted, it can be discovered on your host computer as a new USB device with the USB ID 1f3a:efe8.</p>

<p>Simply run <code>lsusb</code> and it should be there:</p>

<pre><code>lsusb
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 1f3a:efe8
</code></pre>

<p>For further access via FEL mode, we do need to install and compile the very latest version of the sunxi-tools.
As our host computer we&rsquo;re using a Raspberry Pi running <a href="http://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriot-rpi-20151115-132854.img.zip">HypriotOS</a>.
So let&rsquo;s install all the development dependencies we need and then clone the sunxi-tools repo and compile them from source.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y make gcc pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev
makedir -p ~/code
cd ~/code
git clone https://github.com/linux-sunxi/sunxi-tools
cd sunxi-tools
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s see if we can use the sunix-tools to extract some version information about the Pine.</p>

<pre><code>sudo sunxi-fel version
AWUSBFEX soc=00001689(unknown) 00000001 ver=0001 44 08 scratchpad=00017e00 00000000 00000000
</code></pre>

<p>Bingo!</p>

<p>The Pine A64 board is connected and we&rsquo;re getting some version infos like the SOC ID #1689, which basically says it&rsquo;s an Allwinner A64 SOC.
The device itself is classified as &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; because it is too new and the A64 support is not yet merged upstream into the <code>sunxi-fel</code> tool.
But we&rsquo;ll fix this later.</p>

<p>What can we do now with this low-level access via FEL mode?</p>

<p>Well, for instance we could read 128 bytes of the device memory and display it as hex dump on the screen.
Let&rsquo;s start from address 0x0000:</p>

<pre><code>sudo sunxi-fel hexdump 0x0000 128
00000000: 08 00 00 ea 06 00 00 ea 05 00 00 ea 04 00 00 ea  ................

</code></pre>

<p>Or we could just copy the device memory into a file to our host computer and display the content with the <code>hexdump</code> command locally.</p>

<pre><code>sudo sunxi-fel dump 0x0000 128 &gt; memory-dump.bin
hexdump -C memory-dump.bin

<p>As we already explained, the Allwinner SOC is starting it&rsquo;s boot process by loading the BROM
and detects wether it should run a normal boot or start the FEL subroutine. With the help of FEL mode
and the <code>sunxi-fel</code> tool we could also copy and analyse the BROM boot code itself.
The term <a href="http://linux-sunxi.org/BROM">BROM</a> is short for Boot ROM.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s download the BROM directly from the Pine A64 and save it into a local file on our host computer for later analyses.
We just tried to discover where in the memory section we could find the BROM, and read the available documentation for other Allwinner devices.
But the BROM seems to be located at a different memory address than other Allwinner SOC&rsquo;s like the A10 or A20.
The Linux-sunxi Wiki clearly tells us, the BROM has a unique string <code>eGON.BRM</code> near it&rsquo;s starting address.
Details about EGON could be found at <a href="http://linux-sunxi.org/EGON">Linux-sunxi Wiki: EGON</a>.</p>

<p>We are now using the <code>sunxi-fel hexdump</code> command and scanning the memory from the beginning until we&rsquo;ll find this magic string.
And luckily we were able to locate the BROM starting at address 0x2c00, that was really easy to find:</p>

<pre><code>sudo sunxi-fel hexdump 0x2c00 128
00002c00: 07 00 00 ea 07 00 00 ea 65 47 4f 4e 2e 42 52 4d  ........eGON.BRM

<p>Fortunately we can include the brand new A64 support into the <code>sunxi-fel</code> tool by the recent work from Linux-sunxi community member <a href="https://github.com/ssvb">Siarhei Siamashka</a>(ssvb).</p>

<pre><code>cd ~/code/sunxi-tools
mv fel.c fel.c.org
wget https://github.com/ssvb/sunxi-tools/raw/dc77476014669a6f9010a3160357391450a5196e/fel.c
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Wow, it works. The <code>sunxi-fel</code> tool now correctly detects the Pine A64 and the Allwinner A64 SOC.</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo sunxi-fel version
AWUSBFEX soc=00001689(A64) 00000001 ver=0001 44 08 scratchpad=00017e00 00000000 00000000
</code></pre>

<p>With this software and hardware setup done, we&rsquo;re now able to start hacking on the Pine A64 board even for low-level development tasks.
This is necessary for easier development and testing the SPL, U-Boot and the Linux kernel and modules.</p>

<p>TODO: include picture &ldquo;pi2, pine64, sd card on desk&rdquo;</p>

<p>Honestly, the Linux-sunxi community members and kernel developers are doing an incredible job.
Without them it would be really hard or nearly impossible to get a pretty good Linux support soon for the Pine A64 board, and all the other devices with Allwinner SOC&rsquo;s as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>upload and start a new SPL binary</li>
<li>upload and start a new U-Boot binary</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="it-is-about-the-journey-not-the-destination:61f50ba4cfb0b86ed4315ef6497b345f">It is about the journey not the destination</h4>

<p>In that sense we can be thankful that there are still some challenging tasks ahead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supporting the Linux-sunxi community</li>
<li>Developing a SPL binary for A64</li>
<li>Developing a U-Boot binary for A64</li>
<li>Linux kernel development for A64</li>
