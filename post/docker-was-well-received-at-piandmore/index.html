    <h1>Docker was well received at Germany&#39;s biggest Raspberry Pi Jam</h1>
    <span class="post-date">Mon, Jun 13, 2016</span>
    

<p>Last Saturday Germany&rsquo;s biggest Raspberry Pi community event - <a href="http://piandmore.de/en">the PiAndMore</a> - took place for the 9th time.</p>

<p>In cooperation with the University of Trier the organizers were able to provide a broad range of activities.
There were talks, workshops and many interesting tinker projects at display to delight even the most demanding maker heart.</p>

<p>It comes as no suprise that Docker was a hot topic at the PiAndMore conference, too.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="docker-and-the-raspberry-pi-a-dream-team:ce44e480ae6cb7c6d49829357f2a0d42">Docker and the Raspberry Pi - a dream team?</h2>

<p>The Docker Pirates were invited to give a talk about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GovindaFichtner/docker-and-raspberry-pi-a-dream-team">Docker on the Raspberry Pi</a>.<br />
Despite being one of the first talks at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning it was well visited.</p>

<p>After some inital technical problems with the local power supply, network and beamer (yeah - all three!) the talk went well.</p>

<p>I started by giving a short introduction to Docker and finished with a live demo on our 5 node Pico-Cluster.
Starting with some basic Docker Fu the demo soon gathered speed and I showed how to use Docker Compose and Swarm to get a
two tiered microservice architecture up and running in less then 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Here is a recording of the talk made by <a href="https://call-a-tux.de/">Call-a-Tux</a>:

<h2 id="docker-workshop:ce44e480ae6cb7c6d49829357f2a0d42">Docker Workshop</h2>

<p>It seems the talk was able to whet the appetite of the audience as many joined the two hour workshop later.
Soon all seats were taken and the attendees embarked on a whirlwind tour through HypriotOS and Docker.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="/post/hypriotos-barbossa-for-raspberry-pi-3/">HypriotOS</a> and our convenient <a href="https://github.com/hypriot/flash">flash tool</a> everybody was able to start with Docker in no time.<br />
After learning the basic Docker commands everybody started to feel like a real Docker Pirate.</p>

<p>From there it was mostly smooth sailing and we even started to manage our containers with Docker Compose and Swarm.</p>

<p>In the end the workshop was rounded off by an excursion into the realm of Dockerfiles and how to build our own Docker images.</p>

</p>

<p>It was really nice to see so many people get excited about Docker and ask so many curious questions.
Later when I walked through the exhibition part of the conference I even learned that many people came to PiAndMore specifically because of the Docker talk and workshop.</p>

<p>All in all it was awesome being at the PiAndMore conference.
It was really well organized and had a very nice nerdy feel about it.
Actually I had a really hard time to pry my colleague Andreas from the event when we finally had to leave to drive home.</p>

<p>So if you happen to be near Trier next year when the next PiAndMore takes place make sure to pay them a visit.
It is most certainly worth it!</p>
