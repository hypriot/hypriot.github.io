      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday Germany&amp;rsquo;s biggest Raspberry Pi community event - &lt;a href=&#34;http://piandmore.de/en&#34;&gt;the PiAndMore&lt;/a&gt; - took place for the 9th time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cooperation with the University of Trier the organizers were able to provide a broad range of activities.
There were talks, workshops and many interesting tinker projects at display to delight even the most demanding maker heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes as no suprise that Docker was a hot topic at the PiAndMore conference, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-the-raspberry-pi-a-dream-team&#34;&gt;Docker and the Raspberry Pi - a dream team?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker Pirates were invited to give a talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/GovindaFichtner/docker-and-raspberry-pi-a-dream-team&#34;&gt;Docker on the Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Despite being one of the first talks at nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning it was well visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some inital technical problems with the local power supply, network and beamer (yeah - all three!) the talk went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by giving a short introduction to Docker and finished with a live demo on our 5 node Pico-Cluster.
Starting with some basic Docker Fu the demo soon gathered speed and I showed how to use Docker Compose and Swarm to get a
two tiered microservice architecture up and running in less then 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a recording of the talk made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://call-a-tux.de/&#34;&gt;Call-a-Tux&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;iframe id=&#34;ytplayer&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; width=&#34;1000&#34; height=&#34;560&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/9xAkILSdlxE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-workshop&#34;&gt;Docker Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the talk was able to whet the appetite of the audience as many joined the two hour workshop later.
Soon all seats were taken and the attendees embarked on a whirlwind tour through HypriotOS and Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/post/hypriotos-barbossa-for-raspberry-pi-3/&#34;&gt;HypriotOS&lt;/a&gt; and our convenient &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/flash&#34;&gt;flash tool&lt;/a&gt; everybody was able to start with Docker in no time.&lt;br /&gt;
After learning the basic Docker commands everybody started to feel like a real Docker Pirate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there it was mostly smooth sailing and we even started to manage our containers with Docker Compose and Swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the workshop was rounded off by an excursion into the realm of Dockerfiles and how to build our own Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/piandmore/workshop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PiAndMore&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really nice to see so many people get excited about Docker and ask so many curious questions.
Later when I walked through the exhibition part of the conference I even learned that many people came to PiAndMore specifically because of the Docker talk and workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was awesome being at the PiAndMore conference.
It was really well organized and had a very nice nerdy feel about it.
Actually I had a really hard time to pry my colleague Andreas from the event when we finally had to leave to drive home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you happen to be near Trier next year when the next PiAndMore takes place make sure to pay them a visit.
It is most certainly worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
