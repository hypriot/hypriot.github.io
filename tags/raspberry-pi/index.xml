      <title>More Microservices Bliss with Docker 1.12 and Swarm only</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/more-microservice-bliss-with-docker-1-12/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/more-microservice-bliss-with-docker-1-12/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/microservices-bliss-with-docker-and-traefik/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about how easy it is to get a microservice application up and running with Docker and a HTTP proxy called Traefik.
I explained how awesome Traefik is because it makes complex setups with HAProxy, Registrator, Consul, etc. a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really thought it couldn&amp;rsquo;t get much easier. Oh boy - was I wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today as part of the Docker opening keynote Docker demostrated an evolution of Docker Swarm that simplifies this whole scenario even more.
It makes setting up a Docker Swarm Cluster a really simple and straigtforward task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this new thing works&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/more-microservices/swarm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker Swarm&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remember the example from my last post - it consisted of a microservice application made of a frontend and a couple of backend services.
The frontend was a Traefik HTTP proxy that routed the requests to the backend services.
And the backend for the sake of simplicity was just a simple Go-based HTTP webserver that returned the ID of the containers it was running within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/traefik/microsservice_example_end.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Traffic&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Docker Swarm removes the need for a separate HTTP proxy in front of our application containers.
The architecture from above is now slimmed down considerably and looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/more-microservices/architecture_with_swarm.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;With Swarm&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less moving parts - that is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still we get built-in loadbalancing to our backend services. We even can access those services from every node in our cluster.
Docker Swarm has a kind of built-in mesh routing integrated that takes care of routing requests to the appropriate backend containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the new functionality one could assume that setting up a Docker Swarm cluster got even more complicated than before.
But to the contrary - it got much easier - and that by leaps and bounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Just follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed, we are doing this on Raspberry Pi cluster again.
I am using a homegrown version of Docker 1.12 that I installed on my Raspberry Pi.
Hopefully when Docker 1.12 is not a release candidate anymore we will have a version for you ready, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker version
Client:
 Version:      1.12.0-rc1
 API version:  1.24
 Go version:   go1.6.2
 Git commit:   1f136c1-unsupported
 Built:        Wed Jun 15 15:35:51 2016
 OS/Arch:      linux/arm

Server:
 Version:      1.12.0-rc1
 API version:  1.24
 Go version:   go1.6.2
 Git commit:   1f136c1-unsupported
 Built:        Wed Jun 15 15:35:51 2016
 OS/Arch:      linux/arm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. Docker 1.12 RC1 is ready. We should have everything we need to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can find out if we have same new features hidden in our Docker CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker
Usage: docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [arg...]
       docker [ --help | -v | --version ]

A self-sufficient runtime for containers.
    ...
    service   Manage Docker services
    ...
    stats     Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics
    ...
    swarm     Manage Docker Swarm
    ...
    update    Update configuration of one or more containers

Run &#39;docker COMMAND --help&#39; for more information on a command.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I removed the lines of the command output that have not changed compared to the previous release. What remains though is still pretty interesting&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now seem to have a &amp;lsquo;docker swarm&amp;rsquo; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what it is all about&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker swarm

Usage:  docker swarm COMMAND

Manage Docker Swarm

Options:
      --help   Print usage

Commands:
  init        Initialize a Swarm.
  join        Join a Swarm as a node and/or manager.
  update      update the Swarm.
  leave       Leave a Swarm.
  inspect     Inspect the Swarm

Run &#39;docker swarm COMMAND --help&#39; for more information on a command.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &amp;lsquo;Initialize a Swarm.&amp;rsquo; seems to be exactly what we want. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (1njlvzi9rk2syv3xojw217o0g) is now a manager.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a Swarm manger node running it is time to add some more nodes to the cluster.&lt;br /&gt;
And it is really simple as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just go to another node of your cluster and execute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi1 $ docker swarm join pi6:2377
This node joined a Swarm as a worker.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this command we basically just tell new nodes that they should join the Swarm Manager node on which we created the inital Swarm cluster.
In the background Docker Swarm now does some work for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance it sets up encrypted communication channels between the cluster nodes. We do not need to manage TLS certificates on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody who knows how involved it could be to get a Docker Swarm cluster up running in the past should realize how easy it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still we are not yet finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;lsquo;docker info&amp;rsquo; on our Swarm Manager node reveals some interesting tidbits.
Again I removed the uninteresting parts for brevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker info
...
Swarm: active
 NodeID: 1njlvzi9rk2syv3xojw217o0g
 IsManager: Yes
 Managers: 1
 Nodes: 2
 CACertHash: sha256:de4e2bff3b63700aad01df97bbe0397f131aabed5fabb7732283f044472323fc
...
Kernel Version: 4.4.10-hypriotos-v7+
Operating System: Raspbian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
OSType: linux
Architecture: armv7l
CPUs: 4
Total Memory: 925.4 MiB
Name: pi6
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we now have a new &amp;lsquo;Swarm&amp;rsquo; part in the &amp;lsquo;docker info&amp;rsquo; output.
It tells us that our current node is a Swarm Manager node and that the cluster is composed of two cluster nodes in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our second node it looks a bit different as it is not a Manager node:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Swarm: active
 NodeID: 3fmwt4taurwxczr2icboojz8g
 IsManager: No
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unil now we just have an interesting, but still very empty Swarm cluster.
Let&amp;rsquo;s change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start let me introduce you to the concept of a service that is also new abstraction with Docker 1.12.
You might have seen a hint of it already in the output of the Docker command above.
Yes, it is the &amp;lsquo;docker service&amp;rsquo; command that I am talking about.
A Docker service is basically just a bit of software running in a container that offers its &amp;lsquo;service&amp;rsquo; to the outside world and runs on a Swarm cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a service can consist of just one container or of multiple containers.
In the latter case we get high availability and/or loadbalancing for our service out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s create such a service based on our &amp;lsquo;whoami&amp;rsquo; image from my last blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker service create --name whoami -p 80:8000 hypriot/rpi-whoami
buy0q65lw7nshm76kvy5imxk3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the &amp;lsquo;docker swarm ls&amp;rsquo; command we can check the status of our new service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker service ls
ID            NAME    SCALE  IMAGE               COMMAND
buy0q65lw7ns  whoami  1      hypriot/rpi-whoami
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check if we can request the index page from our whoami container by sending I http request via curl to the ip of eth0 network interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ curl http://192.168.178.24
I&#39;m 1b6df814c654
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is working. Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who followed along with keen eyes will have noticed the &amp;lsquo;SCALE&amp;rsquo; part in the header line of the &amp;lsquo;docker swarm ls&amp;rsquo; command.
It seems as we can scale our service somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker service scale whoami=5
whoami scaled to 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK. Let&amp;rsquo;s check what we have now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker service ls
ID            NAME    SCALE  IMAGE               COMMAND
buy0q65lw7ns  whoami  5      hypriot/rpi-whoami

root@pi6 $ for i in {1..5}; do curl http://192.168.178.24; done
I&#39;m 8db1657e8517
I&#39;m e1863a2be88d
I&#39;m 1b6df814c654
I&#39;m 8db1657e8517
I&#39;m e1863a2be88d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not just way more simple than the old Swarm, it also feels much more snappier and faster when executing commands.
And remember I am working on Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s and not on a beefy server like you would propably work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this looks from the perspective of an individual Docker engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi6 $ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
e1863a2be88d        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        8000/tcp            whoami.4.0lg12zndbal72exqe08r9wvpg
8db1657e8517        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        8000/tcp            whoami.5.5z6mvsrdy73m5w24icgsqc8i2
1b6df814c654        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             8 minutes ago       Up 8 minutes        8000/tcp            whoami.1.bg4qlpiye6h6uxyf8cmkwuh52
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the five containers that were started three reside on &amp;lsquo;pi6&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can find the rest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi1 docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
db411a119c0a        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        8000/tcp            whoami.2.2tf7yhmx9haol7e2b7xib2emj
0a4bf32fa9c4        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        8000/tcp            whoami.3.2r6mm091c2ybr0f9jz4qaxw9k
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens when I just leave the Swarm cluster on &amp;lsquo;pi1&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@pi1 docker swarm leave
Node left the default swarm.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I should be two containers short, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we have on our remaining node:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
58620e3d533c        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             46 seconds ago      Up 43 seconds       8000/tcp            whoami.2.cgc4e2ixulc2f3ehr4laoursg
acc9b523f434        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             46 seconds ago      Up 43 seconds       8000/tcp            whoami.3.67bhlo3nwgehthi3bg5bfdzue
e1863a2be88d        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             8 minutes ago       Up 8 minutes        8000/tcp            whoami.4.0lg12zndbal72exqe08r9wvpg
8db1657e8517        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             8 minutes ago       Up 8 minutes        8000/tcp            whoami.5.5z6mvsrdy73m5w24icgsqc8i2
1b6df814c654        hypriot/rpi-whoami:latest   &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;             15 minutes ago      Up 14 minutes       8000/tcp            whoami.1.bg4qlpiye6h6uxyf8cmkwuh52
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we witnessed here is the same what would have happend if we just had a failing &amp;lsquo;pi1&amp;rsquo; node.
All the containers that were running on node &amp;lsquo;pi1&amp;rsquo; were migrated to the remaining cluster nodes automatically.
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to recap what we just did:&lt;br /&gt;
We created a small dynamic microservice applications with just the plain Docker.
Docker Swarm is now integrated into the Docker-Engine instead of being a separate piece of software.
In many cases this makes a separate proxy for the backend services of your application obsolete. No more nginx, HAProxy or Traefik. Sorry to see you go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having less moving parts we now have additional loadbalancing and high availability feature builtin.
I am really looking forward to find out what else there is in store with the new Docker Swarm and how it works together with Docker Compose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker was well received at Germany&#39;s biggest Raspberry Pi Jam</title>

      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-was-well-received-at-piandmore/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday Germany&amp;rsquo;s biggest Raspberry Pi community event - &lt;a href=&#34;http://piandmore.de/en&#34;&gt;the PiAndMore&lt;/a&gt; - took place for the 9th time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cooperation with the University of Trier the organizers were able to provide a broad range of activities.
There were talks, workshops and many interesting tinker projects at display to delight even the most demanding maker heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes as no suprise that Docker was a hot topic at the PiAndMore conference, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/piandmore/piandmore_loves_docker.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PiAndMore&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-the-raspberry-pi-a-dream-team:ce44e480ae6cb7c6d49829357f2a0d42&#34;&gt;Docker and the Raspberry Pi - a dream team?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker Pirates were invited to give a talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/GovindaFichtner/docker-and-raspberry-pi-a-dream-team&#34;&gt;Docker on the Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Despite being one of the first talks at nine o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning it was well visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some inital technical problems with the local power supply, network and beamer (yeah - all three!) the talk went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by giving a short introduction to Docker and finished with a live demo on our 5 node Pico-Cluster.
Starting with some basic Docker Fu the demo soon gathered speed and I showed how to use Docker Compose and Swarm to get a
two tiered microservice architecture up and running in less then 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-workshop:ce44e480ae6cb7c6d49829357f2a0d42&#34;&gt;Docker Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the talk was able to whet the appetite of the audience as many joined the two hour workshop later.
Soon all seats were taken and the attendees embarked on a whirlwind tour through HypriotOS and Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/hypriotos-barbossa-for-raspberry-pi-3/&#34;&gt;HypriotOS&lt;/a&gt; and our convenient &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/flash&#34;&gt;flash tool&lt;/a&gt; everybody was able to start with Docker in no time.&lt;br /&gt;
After learning the basic Docker commands everybody started to feel like a real Docker Pirate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there it was mostly smooth sailing and we even started to manage our containers with Docker Compose and Swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end the workshop was rounded off by an excursion into the realm of Dockerfiles and how to build our own Docker images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/piandmore/workshop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PiAndMore&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really nice to see so many people get excited about Docker and ask so many curious questions.
Later when I walked through the exhibition part of the conference I even learned that many people came to PiAndMore specifically because of the Docker talk and workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was awesome being at the PiAndMore conference.
It was really well organized and had a very nice nerdy feel about it.
Actually I had a really hard time to pry my colleague Andreas from the event when we finally had to leave to drive home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/piandmore/organizers_docker_pirates.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PiAndMore Having fun&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you happen to be near Trier next year when the next PiAndMore takes place make sure to pay them a visit.
It is most certainly worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Microservices Bliss with Docker and Traefik</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/microservices-bliss-with-docker-and-traefik/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2016 09:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/microservices-bliss-with-docker-and-traefik/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I found this really nice and neat HTTP reverse proxy called &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.traefik.io/&#34;&gt;Traefik&lt;/a&gt;.
It is meant to act as frontend proxy for microservices that are provided by a dynamic backend like Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you realize the important part of the last sentence was &lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes Traefik really special is its ability of adding and removing container backend services by listening to Docker events.
So whenever a Docker container is started or stopped Traefik knows about it and adds the container to its list of active backend services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/traefik/architecture.png&#34; alt=&#34;Traffic&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this ability Traefik can replace much more complicated setups based on Nginx or HAProxy that have to use additional tools like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator&#34;&gt;Registrator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consul.io/&#34;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template&#34;&gt;Consul-Template&lt;/a&gt; to achieve the same kind of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me show you with a simple microservice example how easy it is to get started with Traefik&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the following architecture overview we will have a simple HTTP service that answers incoming HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have multiple backend services that are running on different physical nodes for high availability and loadbalancing reasons.
Traefik serves as a frontend proxy that loadbalances incoming requests to the available backend services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traefik as well as the backend services will run on top of a Docker Swarm cluster as containers.
In this example each backend service will answer with their individual container ID to make it easy to see which one answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/traefik/microsservice_example_end.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Traffic&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to get started we need a running Docker Swarm Cluster first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-docker-swarm-cluster:eaccea7a352d1344b842649dc78262ad&#34;&gt;Creating a Docker Swarm Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of fastest and easiest ways to get a Docker Swarm cluster running is to use our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/cluster-lab&#34;&gt;Hypriot Cluster Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cluster Lab comes already preinstalled with out latest HypriotOS &amp;ldquo;Barbossa&amp;rdquo; release for the Raspberr Pi I will show you how to set up a Swarm Cluster with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow along you will need at least three Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s. I will use my Pico-Cluster with five nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/traefik/picocluster.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Traffic&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is flashing the necessary SD card images with HypriotOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clone the Hypriot flash repository and change into the appropriate folder for the operating system you are using to flash the SD cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/hypriot/flash.gi://github.com/hypriot/flash.git
$ cd flash/Darwin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the flash tool ready we now can prepare the SD card for our &lt;strong&gt;leader node&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ./flash --hostname cl-leader https://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriotos-rpi-v0.8.0.img.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat the process for the &lt;strong&gt;follower nodes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ for i in {1..4} do; ./flash --hostname cl-follower${i} https://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriotos-rpi-v0.8.0.img.zip; done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the SD cards for the follower nodes are still being flashed you can already start the leader node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSH into the leader and become root user:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ssh pirate@cl-leader.local
$ sudo su
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the Cluster Lab work with Traefik we need to update to the most recent version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install hypriot-cluster-lab=0.2.13-1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then start the Hypriot Cluster Lab with verbose output logging enabled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ VERBOSE=true cluster-lab start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Cluster Lab starts you can see how it configures itself and does a number of self-tests.
If not all steps are green stop it and start it again. If that fails, too, have a look at our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/cluster-lab#troubleshooting&#34;&gt;troubleshooting section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the leader node is ready, it is time to boot the rest of our nodes and update and start the Cluster Lab in the same fashion.
So go ahead and come back when your are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allright, We can now check if we really have a healthy five nodes Swarm Cluster by executing the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.200.1:2378 docker info | grep Nodes
Nodes: 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And voila we now really have five nodes in our cluster.
Congrats!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you made it so far the rest will be a piece of a cake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-our-microservice-app-with-traefik:eaccea7a352d1344b842649dc78262ad&#34;&gt;Setting up our microservice app with Traefik&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our example microservice application consists of two parts. The Traefik frontend and the WhoAmI application backend.
For both parts I have prepared images for you that can be pulled from the Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Traefik image is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/hypriot/rpi-traefik/&#34;&gt;hypriot/rpi-traefik&lt;/a&gt; and the WhoAmI image is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/hypriot/rpi-whoami/&#34;&gt;hypriot/rpi-whoami&lt;/a&gt;.
The Dockerfiles for both images can be found on Github in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot&#34;&gt;related repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because both Dockerfiles are a fine example of how easy it is to create Docker images for Golang based software I will
show them here, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dockerfile for &amp;ldquo;rpi-traefik&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM hypriot/rpi-alpine-scratch
RUN apk update &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\
    apk upgrade &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\
    apk add ca-certificates &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\
    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
ADD https://github.com/containous/traefik/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.771/traefik_linux-arm /traefik
RUN chmod +x /traefik
EXPOSE 80 8080
ENTRYPOINT [&amp;quot;/traefik&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we just add the Traefik binary on top of an Alpine linux image. The result is an image that is already quite small with about 41 MB.
It propably could be made even smaller by ensuring that the Traefik binary is compiled as a static binary and then putting it into an empty scratch image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how this can be done with the next Dockerfile for the WhoAmI image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dockerfile for &amp;ldquo;rpi-whoami&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM scratch

ADD http /http

ENV PORT 8000
EXPOSE 8000

CMD [&amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With about 3 MB the resulting image is really small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now it is time to put this all together in a Docker Compose application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clone the following repository on you cluster leader:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-cluster-lab-demos
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the cloning is finished change into the &amp;lsquo;traefik&amp;rsquo; folder and use Docker Compose to start our application on top of our little Docker Swarm cluster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cd rpi-cluster-lab-demos/traefik
$ DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.200.1:2378 docker-compose up -d
Creating network &amp;quot;traefik_default&amp;quot; with the default driver
Creating traefik_traefik_1
Creating traefik_whoami_1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this command Docker Compose should start two containers.
One Traefik container on our leader and one WhoAmi container on one of our follower nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s check if that really happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.200.1:2378 docker ps | grep &#39;traefik\|whoami&#39;
cba8d9a7d8f7        hypriot/rpi-whoami         &amp;quot;/http&amp;quot;                  About a minute ago   Up About a minute   8000/tcp                                                 cl-follower1/traefik_whoami_1
7dc2b48a24e2        hypriot/rpi-traefik        &amp;quot;/traefik --web --doc&amp;quot;   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   192.168.200.1:80-&amp;gt;80/tcp, 192.168.200.1:8080-&amp;gt;8080/tcp   cl-leader/traefik_traefik_1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks good. So let&amp;rsquo;s test our application by flinging some HTTP request towards our frontend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ for i in {1..5}; do curl -H Host:whoami.docker.localhost http://192.168.200.1; done
I&#39;am f72892c9187c
I&#39;am f72892c9187c
I&#39;am f72892c9187c
I&#39;am f72892c9187c
I&#39;am f72892c9187c
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see it is always the same backend container which is responding and that&amp;rsquo;s just as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we are going to increase the number of backend containers with the help of Docker Compose scale command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.200.1:2378 docker-compose scale whoami=5
Creating and starting traefik_whoami_2 ... done
Creating and starting traefik_whoami_3 ... done
Creating and starting traefik_whoami_4 ... done
Creating and starting traefik_whoami_5 ... done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can watch as Docker Compose tells Docker Swarm to spin up more containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s verify again if we now have five backend containers running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ for i in {1..5}; do curl -H Host:whoami.docker.localhost http://192.168.200.1; done
I&#39;m 5d829fecbdaa
I&#39;m 5eb115353885
I&#39;m e0313ac24554
I&#39;m 642b5d2c8d09
I&#39;m f72892c9187c
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect. Obviously Traefik did recognise that we started more containers and made them available to the frontend automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see what happened by looking at the logs of the Traefik container:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.200.1:2378 docker-compose logs traefik
...

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the logs we can now clearly see how Traefik catched the Docker event and how it reacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isnt&amp;rsquo; awesome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK. So this was basically our quick tour on how to do set up a simple microservice example with Docker and Traefik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that is left for us now is to clean up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.200.1:2378 docker-compose down -v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you notice the &amp;lsquo;-v&amp;rsquo; option? This seems to be really important as it cleans up all the containers including the overlay network that was created for us.
Without the &amp;lsquo;-v&amp;rsquo; option we would get an error the next time we start the application again with Docker Compose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a good idea to stop the Cluster Lab on all nodes before you switch of your Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cluster-lab stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on all your cluster nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just amazing how many interesting technologies we used in this small blog post.
And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t to hard to get them running together, wasn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is mostly due to the work the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/cluster-lab&#34;&gt;Hypriot Cluster Lab&lt;/a&gt; does for us and of course under the hood it is the Docker-Engine, Docker-Swarm and Docker-Compose that let&amp;rsquo;s us do so much with so little effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So make sure to give our Hypriot Cluster Lab a spin and try some of the examples in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-cluster-lab-demos&#34;&gt;Hypriot Cluster Lab Demos&lt;/a&gt; repository or add some of your own. Pull requests are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always use the comments below to give us feedback and share the news about this release on Twitter, Facebook or Google+.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/making-of-hypriotos/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Today we have released a new version of HypriotOS &amp;ldquo;Barbossa&amp;rdquo; - the SD card image with a ready-to-go Docker toolset for all Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s. Beginning with this release we have &lt;strong&gt;open sourced every step&lt;/strong&gt; to build each parts, from the kernel and root filesystem up to the SD card image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also moved every build step out in the cloud to use the &amp;ldquo;programmable internet&amp;rdquo; to build and test everything with just a &lt;strong&gt;git push&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/making-of-hypriotos/hypriotos-release.png&#34; alt=&#34;release process&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram above shows the release process of a new SD card image for any of the new HypriotOS supported ARM boards. We have moved all building steps to Cloud services. This helps us all to build any SD card without the need to have the specific ARM board. And this also &lt;strong&gt;enables the community to contribute&lt;/strong&gt; to all our repos with pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ci-driven-builds:ce95f1b761ab1b4f8ebf52d516170ec1&#34;&gt;CI driven builds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the SD card images in the Cloud we have chosen a mixture of &lt;strong&gt;Travis CI&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CircleCI&lt;/strong&gt; as the Docker support fits our needs. Only where we need ARM servers to built natively we have our own &lt;strong&gt;Drone&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jenkins&lt;/strong&gt; servers running on Scaleway C1 servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build process downloads some other artifacts like the root filesystem for the specific ARM CPU type and installs further DEB packages like the &lt;strong&gt;Linux kernel&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Docker Engine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each build Travis also runs &lt;strong&gt;Serverspec&lt;/strong&gt; tests against the SD card image to have a minimal test of the generated output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/making-of-hypriotos/travis-serverspec-tests.png&#34; alt=&#34;travis serverspec tests&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we trigger a release build, Travis deploys the newly generated SD card image to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases&#34;&gt;GitHub releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; page. You can find releases, as well as pre-releases of upcoming versions there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;join-the-movement:ce95f1b761ab1b4f8ebf52d516170ec1&#34;&gt;Join the movement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of open sourcing is that the community can give us feedback and sometimes even start contributing back. The SD card image can be built locally on your Linux or Mac notebook as well. So you also are able to build a SD card image without having the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we love Docker the build process runs in a Docker Container. This simplifies the setup on your local machine. Each GitHub repository has a README with the steps needed to build and test the specific HypriotOS SD card image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/making-of-hypriotos/hypriotos-local-build.png&#34; alt=&#34;local build&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal workflow looks like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; - get the repo you want to build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; - create a local VM with Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;make sd-image&lt;/code&gt; - build the SD card image within a Docker Container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;flash sd-card*.zip&lt;/code&gt; - flash the new SD card image and boot your ARM device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BOARD=ip make test-integration&lt;/code&gt; - run Serverspec tests if everything is fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have added over &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/tree/master/builder/test-integration/spec&#34;&gt;200 Serverspec tests&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the Docker tools, Kernel and additional packages are installed correctly. You can even run these tests for the latest release to check if it is working for you as well.
This enables everyone to make changes to the code base and send us Pull Requests without breaking other parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Pull Requests&lt;/strong&gt; are tested with &lt;strong&gt;Travis CI&lt;/strong&gt; of course, so we can see if it works well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/making-of-hypriotos/github-pr-success.png&#34; alt=&#34;pull request successful&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there are several GitHub repositories involved to build the SD card image we use &lt;strong&gt;Waffle.io&lt;/strong&gt; to have and overview of all issues, pull requests and tasks to do for a release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/making-of-hypriotos/waffle.png&#34; alt=&#34;waffle board&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-s-next:ce95f1b761ab1b4f8ebf52d516170ec1&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also started to add more boards and created new GitHub repos for each. But we focused on the Raspberry Pi to finish the &amp;ldquo;Barbossa&amp;rdquo; release. Here is a list of boards we have started to support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero, 1, 2, 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-odroid-c1&#34;&gt;ODROID C1/C1+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-odroid-xu4&#34;&gt;ODROID XU3/XU4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-odroid-c2&#34;&gt;ODROID C2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-bananapi&#34;&gt;Banana Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-nvidia-shieldtv&#34;&gt;NVIDIA ShieldTV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pine A64, &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will pick one of these boards next to add all features of &amp;ldquo;Barbossa&amp;rdquo; to have a great Docker experience with it.
The other boards are still a work in progress - any help is welcome from the community!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HypriotOS 0.8.0 Barbossa for Raspberry Pi 3</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/hypriotos-barbossa-for-raspberry-pi-3/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;While it is quite hard to make something better that is already good, we feel that we were able to just do that with our latest release of HypriotOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HypriotOS is the easiest and fastest way to get you started with Docker on ARM and IoT devices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the perfect playground for your first steps with Docker and it allows you to move to advanced stuff like Docker Clustering without breaking a sweat, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possible because we included a lot of the tools that make the Docker ecosystem awesome - for instance Docker Compose or Docker Swarm - out of the box.
We also integrated the Hypriot Cluster-Lab into this release, which makes it really easy and painless to set up complex Docker Clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. So read on to get all the glory details of this new release &amp;hellip; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/hypriotos-barbossa/iceberg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Raspberry Pi 3&#34; /&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:right; font-size: smaller&#34;&gt;Image courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidw/&#34;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;features-at-a-glance:77d190f6290bd80a7b0b949a77766fb9&#34;&gt;Features at a glance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for Raspberry Pi Zero, 1, 2 and 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux kernel 4.4.10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Engine 1.11.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Compose 1.7.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Machine 0.7.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Swarm 1.2.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cluster-Lab 0.2.12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;device-init 0.1.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;updated-docker-and-docker-tools:77d190f6290bd80a7b0b949a77766fb9&#34;&gt;Updated Docker and Docker-Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to our latest HypriotOS Berry 0.7 we did upgrade the Docker Engine to v1.11 which now has several binaries instead of one.
Besides the original Docker binary there is now also a Containerd and a runC binary. Containerd is basically a supervisor for individual containers that are run by runC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for splitting up the Docker binary were the efforts of Docker to support the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opencontainers.org/&#34;&gt;standardization of container technology&lt;/a&gt; and to make it easier to maintain the existing technology stack.
You can get a good overview about these changes in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.docker.com/2016/04/docker-engine-1-11-runc/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the release of Docker 1.11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is also a very interesting deep dive into the details of those changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe id=&#34;ytplayer&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; width=&#34;1000&#34; height=&#34;560&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/QL8F2MLCybo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-raspberry-pi-3-support:77d190f6290bd80a7b0b949a77766fb9&#34;&gt;Full Raspberry Pi 3 Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noteworthy is also that we now have full support for the Raspberry Pi 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/flash&#34;&gt;flash-tool&lt;/a&gt; it is really easy to bring a Raspberry Pi 3 online with only WiFi network connectivity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;flash --ssid MyNetworkName --password SomeSecret https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases/download/v0.8.0/hypriotos-rpi-v0.8.0.img.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that you can usually connect to your Pi by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh pirate@black-pearl.local
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The password is &amp;lsquo;hypriot&amp;rsquo;. And that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way this also works if you attach an external WiFi adapter to a Raspberry Pi Zero, 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;customizing-your-raspberry-pi-configuration:77d190f6290bd80a7b0b949a77766fb9&#34;&gt;Customizing your Raspberry Pi Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to customize the hostname of your Pi, to add WiFi credentials and more is made possible by a small tool of ours called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/device-init&#34;&gt;device-init&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous versions we used a tool called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Occi&#34;&gt;occi&lt;/a&gt; from Adafruit to allow hostname and WiFi customization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this release we removed it and replaced it with device-init.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;device-init is a small programm that is started when your Raspberry Pi boots and it allows to customize a couple of settings.
It takes its configuration from a file called &amp;lsquo;device-init.yaml&amp;rsquo; which is located in the /boot directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This /boot directory is basically a small FAT partition on the SD card that contains HypriotOS.
It can be easily accessed from your host computer before you boot your Pi. You can edit the &amp;lsquo;device-init.yaml&amp;rsquo; file directly with a text editor or by using the flash tool as demonstrated above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to add more features - like adding public ssh keys, setting the locale or timezone - to device-init step by step in the next weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hypriot-cluster-lab:77d190f6290bd80a7b0b949a77766fb9&#34;&gt;Hypriot Cluster-Lab&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added the Hypriot Cluster-Lab to the image, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is disabled by default, but can easily be enabled when you flash the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;flash --clusterlab true https://github.com/hypriot/image-builder-rpi/releases/download/v0.8.0/hypriotos-rpi-v0.8.0.img.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting this options starts the Cluster-Lab on boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By flashing a couple of SD cards with different hostnames and Cluster-Lab enabled you can get a fully working Docker Swarm cluster up and running in minutes.
The individual machines will find themselves automatically and form a Swarm cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the Hypriot Cluster-Lab and why it is awesome on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/cluster-lab/&#34;&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the new release in our &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads&#34;&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or Microsoft Windows meets Docker ARM Containers for IoT</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Running an ARM-based Docker container for IoT applications directly on Microsoft Windows
looks like an unbelievable &lt;strong&gt;extraterrestrial technology&lt;/strong&gt; from outer space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cannot be true, it must be a fake, right?&lt;br /&gt;
Or, is this maybe just a &lt;strong&gt;cheap magic trick&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind/docker4win-arm-webpage.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Windows&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, believe me, that&amp;rsquo;s really true&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;behind-the-scenes:41ce06d9c70eae57025ae829633db5ae&#34;&gt;Behind the scenes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I showed in my last blog post about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/&#34;&gt;First Touch Down with Docker for Mac&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; uses an Alpine Linux VM under the hood with the capability of emulating
ARM binaries on Intel CPUs. Because of &amp;ldquo;Docker for Windows&amp;rdquo; uses exactly the same
Alpine Linux in a Hyper-V virtual machine, this should work on Windows 10, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem here is, that the bind-mounting of a single binary doesn&amp;rsquo;t work
right now on Windows. I guess this will be fixed in a later release for sure. But
we can easily prepare an ARM-based Docker container to make the magic happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just have to put the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU&#34;&gt;QEMU&lt;/a&gt; emulator binary
into the Docker container, and as long as we
place it at the correct path &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/qemu-arm-static&lt;/code&gt;, this should work. The easiest
way to include the binary to the correct folder is to create a tar archive and use
the ADD command in the Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar vtf qemu-arm-static.tar
drwxr-xr-x  0 dieter staff       0 Mar 28 18:34 usr/
drwxr-xr-x  0 dieter staff       0 Mar 28 18:34 usr/bin/
-rwxr-xr-x  0 dieter staff 2899840 Mar 28 18:34 usr/bin/qemu-arm-static
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;dockerfile:41ce06d9c70eae57025ae829633db5ae&#34;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM hypriot/rpi-busybox-httpd
ADD qemu-arm-static.tar /
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this easy preparation we&amp;rsquo;re able to start an ARM-based Docker container on
Windows 10 with two steps only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Create the modified Docker image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker build -t rpi-busybox-httpd .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Start the QEMU-enabled Docker container&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -d -p 80:80 rpi-busybox-httpd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in this screenshot you can see all the necessary steps we need, there is really
nothing else to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind/docker4win-arm-container.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Windows&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voilà&lt;/strong&gt; - that was the magic trick which can be applied to almost all ARM-based Docker
images to make them run in &amp;ldquo;Docker for Windows&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; even on an Intel-based
CPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;watch-the-results:41ce06d9c70eae57025ae829633db5ae&#34;&gt;Watch the results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Docker for Windows&amp;rdquo; publishes the Docker Engine network with the local network name
&lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;. Thus to access the ARM web server, which is running inside of a Linux container,
 we just have to point our preferred web browser to &lt;code&gt;http://docker/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/close-encounters-of-the-third-kind/docker4win-arm-webpage2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Windows&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways:41ce06d9c70eae57025ae829633db5ae&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Docker for Windows&amp;rdquo; uses Windows native hypervisor Hyper-V&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Docker Engine is running in a tiny Alpine Linux VM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARM-based Docker containers can be easily enabled with QEMU emulator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker works great on Windows 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you curious now and want to get in touch with &amp;ldquo;Docker for Windows&amp;rdquo; by yourself?
Then you should register for the Docker BETA program at &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.docker.com&#34;&gt;https://beta.docker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your No. 1 source for Docker on ARM</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/your-number-one-source-for-docker-on-arm/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 22:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/your-number-one-source-for-docker-on-arm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides our &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/&#34;&gt;Download section&lt;/a&gt; we do have another source for getting the latest and greatest Docker for ARM.&lt;br /&gt;
It is a debian package repository hosted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://packagecloud.io/&#34;&gt;packagecloud.io&lt;/a&gt; that contains lots of the stuff from our Download section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having a package repository for a couple of months now, it seems many people do not know it.
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s our own fault because we never spoke about it - we only added it to our prepared SD card images. :)
Installing or updating Docker or other Docker goodies like Docker-Compose from this repository can be done by a simple &lt;code&gt;apt-get install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I gonna show you what you need to know to get started with this repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/packagecloud/packagecloud_io_wide.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Raspberry Pi Workshop in Brussels&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packagecloud.io is a really great service for hosting different types of packages (DEBs, RPMs, Ruby Gems).
You get detailed download/usage statistics and can manage all your packages easily with a Web-GUI or with an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point was what convinced us to use packagecloud.io as it allows us to upload our packages directly from our Continuous Integration systems.
Many popular CI systems offer build-in packagecloud support - for instance Travis or Circle-CI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our packagecloud repository is conveniently named &amp;ldquo;Schatzkiste&amp;rdquo; and supports Debian-based Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use it you need to configure &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo; first by executing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/Hypriot/Schatzkiste/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what this script does you can look up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://packagecloud.io/Hypriot/Schatzkiste/install&#34;&gt;source of this script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It installs &amp;lsquo;apt-transport-https&amp;rsquo; for connecting securely to our repository, adds the packagecloud GPG key to &amp;lsquo;apt&amp;rsquo; and then adds our &amp;lsquo;Schatzkiste&amp;rsquo;-repository sources to &amp;lsquo;/etc/apt/sources.list.d/Hypriot_Schatzkiste.list&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Afterwards it updates the package sources via &amp;lsquo;apt-get update&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there you are ready to search for the latest Docker via&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install it with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to close this blog post with a huge thank you to the packagecloud.io guys as they are hosting our packages for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend their service as it can be so tedious and time-consuming to setup your own repository properly - I have been there myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, use the comments below to give us feedback and share this post on Twitter, Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Touch Down with Docker for Mac</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, Docker has announced a closed BETA program for their new
applications &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Docker for Windows&amp;rdquo;. These apps are meant to
simplify the usage of Docker containers for every developer even more. They try
to lower the barrier to install and use Docker on your desktop and laptop computers
for both Mac and Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I received the first rumors that there is a special feature built-in,
which should also simplify the developers workflow for IoT applications, I was getting
totally thrilled and registered immediately for the BETA program. It was really hard
to wait for, but luckily I&amp;rsquo;ve received an email with my BETA invitation and access
token within a few hours only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you a first insight view how to install and use &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo;
with a basic walk-through on my MacBook Pro running the very latest OS X 10.11.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-copy-app.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, please join me on this journey&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;access-to-the-beta-program:10b72799563d55724d4550d1181f06ee&#34;&gt;Access to the BETA program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily register to the Docker BETA program at &lt;a href=&#34;https://beta.docker.com&#34;&gt;https://beta.docker.com&lt;/a&gt;. Once
you&amp;rsquo;re logged in with your Docker ID (which is literally your Docker Hub user account)
you can apply for testing &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Docker for Windows&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-apply-for-beta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is a closed BETA, you&amp;rsquo;ll get on a waiting list and hopefully will be selected
soon. So, please be patient until you&amp;rsquo;ll receive an invitation email with some more
detailed instructions and a personal access key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how easy it is to install and use Docker on OS X.
And I guess, we&amp;rsquo;ll write another post later for all the curious Windows users,  too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;download-and-install-docker-for-mac:10b72799563d55724d4550d1181f06ee&#34;&gt;Download and install &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re selected for the BETA, you&amp;rsquo;ll receive an email titled &amp;ldquo;Docker Private Beta&amp;rdquo;
with a link to the download page and an access key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-download-page.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the installer package called &amp;ldquo;Docker.dmg&amp;rdquo; to your Mac and double click it,
drag and drop the &amp;ldquo;Docker beta&amp;rdquo; app to your Applications folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-copy-app.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, from your Lauchpad you can start the &amp;ldquo;Docker beta&amp;rdquo; app directly the first time
and you can begin right away using Docker on your Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-start-app.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start the BETA Docker app the first time you&amp;rsquo;ll be asked to enter your
personal invite token.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-install-01-insert-key.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Token has been accepted.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-install-02-key-accepted.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker app needs to additionally install a network helper and requests for privileges
to do so.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-install-03-request-privileges.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your credentials to grant privileged access.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-install-04-grant-privileges.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success, the Docker app is installed and you can easily find and access it by
clicking on the little neat whale icon.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-install-05-tray-icon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-docker-for-mac-the-first-time:10b72799563d55724d4550d1181f06ee&#34;&gt;Using &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; the first time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Docker we&amp;rsquo;ll just start a terminal window and use the Docker CLI to access
the local Docker Engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, get the version of the Docker command:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-run-docker-01-dash-v.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determine the versions of the Docker Client and the Docker Engine:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-run-docker-02-version.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Display some more detailed informations about the installed Docker software:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-run-docker-03-info.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-s-start-a-real-docker-container:10b72799563d55724d4550d1181f06ee&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start a real Docker container&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we&amp;rsquo;ll check how our host operating system looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;uname -a
Darwin demo.local 15.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 15.4.0: Fri Feb 26 22:08:05 PST 2016; root:xnu-3248.40.184~3/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already expected we see our host OS is OS X or &lt;code&gt;Darwin&lt;/code&gt; with a kernel version &lt;code&gt;15.4.0&lt;/code&gt;. Our CPU architecture is &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;, which indicates that we&amp;rsquo;re running on an Intel-based
64-bit CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, let&amp;rsquo;s start a basic Linux container and here we&amp;rsquo;re using a Debian standard distro
for now. This will take a few second because the Docker Engine has to fetch/download
the Docker image &lt;code&gt;debian&lt;/code&gt; from the Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm -ti debian
Unable to find image &#39;debian:latest&#39; locally
latest: Pulling from library/debian
fdd5d7827f33: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for debian:latest
root@9473484ea965:/#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we now do have an interactive bash prompt within a running Debian
Linux container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@9473484ea965:/# uname -a
Linux 9473484ea965 4.1.19 #1 SMP Sun Mar 20 22:13:39 UTC 2016 x86_64 GNU/Linux

root@9473484ea965:/# cat /etc/os-release

BUG_REPORT_URL=&amp;quot;https://bugs.debian.org/&amp;quot;
root@9473484ea965:/#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to start a really tiny Linux container next, which starts even
faster than Debian. Alpine Linux is meant to be super-small and it brings a lot
of advantages into the container world, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting an interactive Alpine container is pretty much the same as Debian, but we
have to use a Bourne shell instead of bash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm -ti alpine sh
Unable to find image &#39;alpine:latest&#39; locally
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
4d06f2521e4f: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
/ #
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this container is running on the same kernel version like before, but
uses a completely different Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/ # uname -a
Linux 411883bd07d3 4.1.19 #1 SMP Sun Mar 20 22:13:39 UTC 2016 x86_64 Linux

/ # cat /etc/os-release
NAME=&amp;quot;Alpine Linux&amp;quot;
ID=alpine
VERSION_ID=3.3.1
PRETTY_NAME=&amp;quot;Alpine Linux v3.3&amp;quot;
HOME_URL=&amp;quot;http://alpinelinux.org&amp;quot;
BUG_REPORT_URL=&amp;quot;http://bugs.alpinelinux.org&amp;quot;
/ #
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the details of these both Docker containers. Both are complete
Linux systems, but with a substantial difference in size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
alpine              latest              70c557e50ed6        3 weeks ago         4.798 MB
debian              latest              f50f9524513f        3 weeks ago         125.1 MB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpine Linux is damn small in size and thus the Docker images built upon Alpine
are extremely small as well, and much faster to download. Another major advantage is the
security model of Alpine Linux, which reduces the attack surface dramatically and
provides faster and easier security updates as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experiment with &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; clearly demonstrates that we can run Linux
commands inside Docker containers with a Linux OS and a recent kernel version 4.1.19. This is indeed different to our host operating system OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pure Docker container magic: running a Linux container seamlessly on our
development machine, here on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-magic-behind-the-scenes:10b72799563d55724d4550d1181f06ee&#34;&gt;The Magic behind the scenes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve shown you in the screenshots above, our host operating system, where the Docker
Client is running, is &lt;code&gt;darwin/amd64&lt;/code&gt; or OS X, but the Docker Engine runs on &lt;code&gt;linux/amd64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re wondering how this even can be possible, right?&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is quite easy, &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; is shipping it&amp;rsquo;s own lightweight hypervisor
called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xhyve.org/&#34;&gt;xhyve&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is a port of the BSD hypervisor
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bhyve.org/&#34;&gt;bhyve&lt;/a&gt; to OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engineers at Docker have greatly enhanced xhyve to enable an optimized usage
to efficiently run Docker containers on OS X. Inside of the xhyve hypervisor,
the Docker Engine is running in a tiny small Linux VM, which is based upon the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alpinelinux.org&#34;&gt;Alpine Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution. With this great combination
of outstanding technologies we as users get the feeling to run Docker containers
natively on our Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there are even more great technical details packed into the new &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo;
release, but we&amp;rsquo;ll keep them for a later more advanced technical blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;there-is-another-big-arm-surprise:10b72799563d55724d4550d1181f06ee&#34;&gt;There is another big ARM surprise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the public announcement of &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo;, I received an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/avsm/status/713010884596080640&#34;&gt;Easter Egg tweet&lt;/a&gt; from one
of the Docker engineers, Anil Madhavapeddy, that they&amp;rsquo;ve just included another cool
feature, which attracts me most. He promised I could even run the Docker images, which
I built for an IoT device like a Raspberry Pi on my Mac now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No way, that sounds to good to be true. And mainly because the Raspberry Pi uses
an ARM CPU, which cannot be executed on an Intel-based Mac, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this, I&amp;rsquo;ll select one of my most famous Docker containers:
the webserver I&amp;rsquo;ve presented at DockerCon 2015 San Francisco, CA, last year in June (more details can be found in a dedicated blog post about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/dockercon2015/&#34;&gt;Hypriot-Demo and challenge at DockerCon 2015&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, here we go. Let&amp;rsquo;s run an ARM container on a Mac:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-arm-container-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;hmmm, but maybe with some more magic Docker spells it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-arm-container-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where all the magic happens. We&amp;rsquo;re just bind-mounting a special binary
into our original ARM-based container. Again, we don&amp;rsquo;t change the original Docker
image to get this done. In the end we are really able to run an ARM container,
which was built on a Raspberry Pi, now on an Intel-based Mac - just with the help
of some &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/quintus23m/status/713523016836231171&#34;&gt;fantastic Docker fu&lt;/a&gt;
embedded in &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-arm-container-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a last proof, we check with &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; that we&amp;rsquo;re running the original ARM container from June 2015:
&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/first-touch-down-with-docker-for-mac/docker4mac-arm-container-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker for Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possible because the Docker engineers have already included the Linux kernel support
for &lt;code&gt;binfmt_misc&lt;/code&gt; into &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo;. And as long as there is the right Qemu interpreter
&lt;code&gt;qemu-arm-static&lt;/code&gt; (which is an Intel binary itself) placed in the ARM container,
this container can be executed, or better emulated, even on a foreign CPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can clearly imagine to use &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; as part of a new Docker-centric workflow
to build IoT containers directly on my Mac. Development and testing can be done fast and
efficiently on the developers machine and then deploying and running the IoT containers
on the target device. A few months ago such an idea has sound pretty crazy and unbelievable -
but now it&amp;rsquo;s coming true soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Anil, Justin and all the other great guys at the Docker engineering
team to make this magic true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways:10b72799563d55724d4550d1181f06ee&#34;&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this first and fast walk-through, I guess you&amp;rsquo;re even more curious and you&amp;rsquo;d
like to use &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; by yourself. So in the meantime I&amp;rsquo;ll just summarize the
key points what impressed me most about this great new release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;installing &amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; was pretty easy and slick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single &lt;code&gt;.dmg&lt;/code&gt; media with 90 MByte only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; is a real native OS X application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are absolutely no other external resources or dependencies to install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Docker for Mac&amp;rdquo; integrates perfectly into your development workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;downloading, installing and running the first Docker container takes a few minutes only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for tiny containers, Alpine Linux is one of the best Linux distros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ARM IoT containers can be developed and run even on a Mac&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;much more will be revealed in later blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send us your feedback on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitter.im/hypriot/talk&#34;&gt;Gitter channel&lt;/a&gt; or tweet your thoughts and ideas on this project at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HypriotTweets&#34;&gt;@HypriotTweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let&#39;s build a PicoCluster for Docker Swarm</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/lets-build-a-pi-docker-picocluster/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 18:40:04 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/lets-build-a-pi-docker-picocluster/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;As we love to use Docker Swarm on a cluster of Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s, we&amp;rsquo;d like to cover
in this hands-on tutorial how to build such a cluster easily with a hardware kit
from &lt;a href=&#34;http://picocluster.com&#34;&gt;PicoCluster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is a PicoCluster kit for a 3-node or 5-node cluster, a couple of
Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s and the time to assemble all the parts together. The project can be
completed within an hour only, and makes so much fun, too - especially when you can
share this as quality time with your kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-3node-pdu-tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 3-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PicoCluster had just sent us two different kits of their cool Raspberry Pi
clusters. Of course, we are eager to build these new clusters so you can get a first impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-s-in-the-box:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in the box&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5-node PicoCluster kit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acrylic case, all parts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;internal 8-port Ethernet switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDU (12V input, 5x USB 5V output), including all wires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wiring for 5x microUSB power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wiring for network (Raspberry Pi to Ethernet switch)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;case wiring for 1x HDMI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;case wiring for 2x USB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;case wiring for 1x 12V power plug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;base mounting for Pi tower, including all crews, nuts &amp;amp; bolts, spacers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-5node-parts.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 5-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not included in the kits: (so you have to buy it separately)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi’s and microSD cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AC adapter (12V, 1.5A, barrel plug 5.5x2.1mm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally we&amp;rsquo;ll need some common tools for the mechanical assembling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;philips screw driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7mm wrench (or a pliers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/tools-screwdriver-wrench.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster toosl&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembling-the-3-node-picocluster:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Assembling the 3-node PicoCluster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;towering-the-raspberry-pi-s:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Towering the Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we take the mounting plate for the Pi tower and stack all
three Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s with the help of the included spacers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-3node-pi-tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 3-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;wiring-all-together:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Wiring all together&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s easy to mount the PDU on top of the Pi tower with 4 screws and attaching
the USB power cables to the three Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-3node-pdu-tower2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 3-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we mount the tower on the base plate, which makes our new cluster look even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-3node-base-tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 3-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to complete the cluster installation: We connect
the 12V power cable to the PDU and front cover. We can also attach the HDMI cable
to the upper Raspberry Pi and mount the other end to the front cover, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;assembling-the-case:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Assembling the case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we mount the side and back cover and put on the top plate.
Mounting with nuts &amp;amp; bolts and the PicoCluster is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to flash your microSD cards and insert them into the Pi&amp;rsquo;s,
because as soon as we close the cluster case, it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit harder to change
the SD cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-3node-completed.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 3-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembling-the-5-node-picocluster:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Assembling the 5-node PicoCluster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;towering-the-raspberry-pi-s-1:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Towering the Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 5-node cluster we start similar as with the 3-node. We take
the mounting plate for the Pi tower and stack all five Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s with the
spacers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-5node-pi-tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 5-node&#34; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-5node-pi-tower2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 5-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;wiring-all-together-1:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Wiring all together&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we mount the PDU on top of the Pi tower with 4 screws and attach
the USB power cables to the five Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-5node-pdu-tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 5-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we mount the tower on the base plate, we see that we do have a lot more
parts left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-5node-base-tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 5-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 5-node cluster we have an internal dedicated 8-port switch, which we&amp;rsquo;ll
install inside the case and wire all the ethernet cables to the Pi&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-5node-ethernet-switch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 5-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to complete the cluster installation: We connect
the 12V power cable to the PDU and front cover. We can also attach the HDMI cable
to the upper Raspberry Pi and mount the other end to the front cover, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-5node-switch-tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 5-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also find two USB cables in the kit, which you can connect to one or two
different Pi&amp;rsquo;s and mount the plug to the front panel as well. Attaching HDMI and USB
plugs to the case is really optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;assembling-the-case-1:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Assembling the case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we mount the side and back cover and put on the top plate.
Mounting with nuts &amp;amp; bolts and our second PicoCluster is almost ready. As there are a
few more parts to assemble the 5-node cluster, it will take a little bit longer than
building the smaller cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;finally-we-have-two-new-clusters:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Finally, we have two new clusters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end we have now built two new Raspberry Pi clusters, a 3-node and a 5-node
from PicoCluster. Both are looking really neat and everything is stowed away in
a perfect way. Only accessing the microSD cards is not optimal once after the case
is closed. You just have to remove only a few screws and dismounting the rear side
panel of the case and then you can easily access the SD card slots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/picocluster-kits/picocluster-3node-and-5node-cluster.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoCluster 3- and 5-node&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the 5-node cluster includes an integrated 8-port Ethernet switch, we&amp;rsquo;d recommend
it to use as a standalone Pi cluster for experimenting with Docker Swarm and other
cluster related tutorials and demos. You just have to attach a 12V power source and
a single network link. This is all you need to start playing with it right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you can go ahead and install software on your new PicoCluster.
However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t within the scope of this hands-on project, so we&amp;rsquo;ll point you to one of our
latest tutorials where you learn &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/how-to-setup-rpi-docker-swarm/&#34;&gt;how to setup a Docker Swarm cluster with Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-can-you-get-it:098640bbbda183ea709087a458ce9550&#34;&gt;Where can you get it ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can order your own ready-to-use and tiny data center directly at &lt;a href=&#34;http://picocluster.com&#34;&gt;PicoCluster&lt;/a&gt;
with the Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s included. The hardware kits we used in this post should be available soon, too.
PicoCluster is currently optimizing a few parts like the PDU to get more power for the new Raspberry Pi 3,
so we expect the next version will get some changes and improvements compared to these
beta units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send us your feedback on our &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitter.im/hypriot/talk&#34;&gt;Gitter channel&lt;/a&gt; or tweet your thoughts and ideas on this project at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HypriotTweets&#34;&gt;@HypriotTweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker on Raspberry Pi Workshop in Brussels</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-on-arm-workshops/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/docker-on-arm-workshops/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago we have been invited by the fine folks over at the Docker User Group in Brussels to help conduct a workshop.
And of course this workshop was about Docker. Still it was not your ordinary Docker workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was special because instead of being a workshop about Docker on big servers it was about Docker on really small ARM devices.
The very same devices that power the upcoming IoT revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it is really amazing what you can do with Docker on those tiny machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/raspberry-pi-workshop/docker_workshop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Raspberry Pi Workshop in Brussels&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this workshop attendees learned how to get started with Docker on their Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.
Starting with the basics they soon turned to advanced topics like building a Docker cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is Raspberry Pi and how is it working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to flash an SD card with HypriotOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to log in to a Raspberry Pi via SSH or serial console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to do basic stuff with Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is different when using Docker on ARM compared to Intel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to build a Docker Cluster with Docker Swarm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dieter Reuter from our team gave an introductory talk and showed off some of the cool things we did at Hypriot.
About 70 people attended the workshop and worked in small groups and helped each other to learn new stuff.
Even days after the event Dieter was still raving about the cool event and the amazing, open-minded and friendly people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the pictures it was a lot of fun to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks for making the workshop possible need to go to Damien Duportal.
His workshop presentation can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://dduportal.github.io/presentations/docker-meetup-brussels-20160210/#1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The example app that was used during the workshop was ported to ARM and can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jmMeessen/rpi-voting-app/commits/master&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We - at the Hypriot team - are really excited to see how more and more people start to see the potential in Docker on ARM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I was approached by Bastiaan Schaap from the DevOps Oost-Nederland Meetup Group to help organize a similar workshop.
It will take place on &lt;strong&gt;June, 1st in Wageningen in the Netherlands&lt;/strong&gt;. You can read more about the agenda on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/DevOps-OostNL/events/229287742/?eventId=229287742&#34;&gt;Meetup-Website&lt;/a&gt;.
Make sure to RSVP early as there will only be a limited number of seats available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to do some more workshops in the next couple of months. So if you like to see one happen in your area - please come and talk to us.
We really have a lot of fun organizing and conducting these kind of events and can come up with a ton of different workshop topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this sense - hope to see you soon in person.
Happy ARM hacking until then. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, use the comments below to give us feedback and share this post on Twitter, Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docker Sensor Fu on a Raspberry Pi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many people it comes as a surprise that one can access all the hardware of an IoT device from within a Docker container.
Interestingly enough Docker is a perfect tool for managing and distributing IoT development and production environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this use case we are going to create a Docker image that allows us to read the data from a temperature sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/docker-sensor-fu-on-a-raspberry-pi/temperature.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker Swarm&#34; /&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:right; font-size: smaller&#34;&gt;Image courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tmib/3336410263/in/photolist-65PYwT-hKwdXx-6Gvfse-8sZyde-hKwe8n-bsrVBM-aTuQm-suTVL-4keeLT-9HAaQv-6owaBS-pcKw75-ktYU9-7fCvHx-aMp4hZ-9CJPmM-5kQCwW-9uhoBD-i6h8R-8eACxB-73fGHE-ecUmhW-4ayKHW-coQnPs-x2g2w-qTtWEg-6afv15-7zQM2j-coQoDf-6uLDRM-5srT3L-hpQH9p-q1QZca-9S8ygg-mHCs1e-aZ3SJT-b3ejpi-qvDRpB-mBUjjp-mJTYFr-nhZUoo-6dRUnb-9tuUnt-eMRL2K-6K6ars-dhBwB7-5Cr4jF-5rq6uU-yzubv-q7g6xP&#34;&gt;tmib_seattle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow along you gonna need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a Raspberry Pi 1, 2 or 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our HypriotOS &lt;a href=&#34;https://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriot-rpi-20160306-192317.img.zip&#34;&gt;SD card image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a DHT22 temperature sensor, which you can buy at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00LHJUU1M?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the hardware side we need to first attach the sensor to our Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/docker-sensor-fu-on-a-raspberry-pi/temperature_sensor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker Swarm&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the picture of the sensor from left to right we need to attach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the yellow cable to the 3,3V Pin of the RPi (Pin 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the green cable (data) to one of the many GPIO; here it is GPIO2 (Pin 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and finally the blue cable to GND (Pin 6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information in brackets corresponds to the pin numbers in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://raspi.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rev2-GPIO-bold.jpg&#34;&gt;GPIO overview image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/docker-sensor-fu-on-a-raspberry-pi/sensor_connected_to_pi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Docker Swarm&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our hardware is settled we need to look at the software side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As foundation for our next steps we will use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiringpi.com/&#34;&gt;WiringPi&lt;/a&gt; project.
WiringPi is a library that allows to access the GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) connectors of the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s put WiringPi into a Docker image, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dockerfile for this looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/Govinda-Fichtner/1d48543a6b9c2e21b7c1.js?file=Dockerfile.start&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this Dockerfile we can now build our image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ docker build -t hypriot/wiringpi:latest .
...
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hypriot/wiringpi                      latest              599e98bd4c20        30 seconds ago      302.2 MB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the image has everything that we need to compile software. On top of that it also has the WiringPi libraries on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we can run this image to build the software that actually reads the sensor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ docker run --device /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyAMA0 --device /dev/mem:/dev/mem --privileged -ti hypriot/wiringpi bash
root@84f66e14df05:/data#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test if we can access the GPIO&amp;rsquo;s we can run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@84f66e14df05:/data# gpio readall

 +-----+-----+---------+------+---+---Pi 2---+---+------+---------+-----+-----+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to clone the source of our sensor reading software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@84f66e14df05:/data# git clone https://github.com/technion/lol_dht22
root@84f66e14df05:/data# cd lol_dht22
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compile the lol_dht22 software we do the usual &lt;code&gt;./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@84f66e14df05:/data/lol_dht22# ./configure
...
root@84f66e14df05:/data/lol_dht22# make
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should produce a small executable that we can now test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you followed the wiring instructions above closely you should now be able to read the temperature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@84f66e14df05:/data/lol_dht22# ./loldht 8
Raspberry Pi wiringPi DHT22 reader
www.lolware.net
Humidity = 34.00 % Temperature = 22.80 *
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome. We just have been accessing the hardware sensor that is attached to our Pi from inside a Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is this so exciting? Well, it basically allows us to deploy our sensor reading software easily and reliably to every device that is running a Docker Engine.
No installation hassle. No dependency hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that we need to extend our Dockerfile and add&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;RUN git clone https://github.com/technion/lol_dht22
RUN cd lol_dht22 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./configure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv ./lol_dht22 /usr/local/bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/Govinda-Fichtner/1d48543a6b9c2e21b7c1.js?file=Dockerfile.final&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After rebuilding the image with this updated Dockerfile we can now run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ docker run --device /dev/ttyAMA0:/dev/ttyAMA0 --device /dev/mem:/dev/mem --privileged -ti hypriot/wiringpi /loldht 8
Raspberry Pi wiringPi DHT22 reader
www.lolware.net
Data not good, skip
Humidity = 35.00 % Temperature = 22.00 *C
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it just works&amp;trade;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished image can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/hypriot/wiringpi/&#34;&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to build a traffic light</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/traffic-light/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2016 17:31:10 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/traffic-light/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My seven year old asked me how does a traffic light work. Before explaining too much we put some LEDs and wires together and did a hands-on tutorial. Finally we had a pedestrian crossing with a push button controlled by an app - of course - running dockerized on a Raspberry Pi 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/traffic-light/traffic-light.png&#34; alt=&#34;Traffic light wiring&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hardware:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;The hardware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we have to build the curcuit. To follow this tutorial you need these parts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 3, but any other is also good for this tutorial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breadboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x Red, 1x yellow and 2x green LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5x 220Ω resistors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x 1kΩ resistor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x 10kΩ resistor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x push button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x USB power for the Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-software:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;The software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application is written in Python and it is based on the blog post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bobrathbone.com/pi_traffic_led.htm&#34;&gt;Raspberry PI Traffic Lights&lt;/a&gt; by Bob Rathbone. I have added some more LEDs and changed it to our local traffic light scheme. You can find the full source code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-rpi-traffic-light&#34;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defining-the-gpio-pins:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Defining the GPIO pins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/StefanScherer/docker-rpi-traffic-light/raw/master/pedestrian-crossing.py?slice=16:30&amp;footer=minimal&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initializing-the-gpio-ports:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Initializing the GPIO ports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the app we initialize the GPIO ports and turn off all LEDs. They may turned on from aborting a previous run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/StefanScherer/docker-rpi-traffic-light/raw/master/pedestrian-crossing.py?slice=31:48&amp;footer=minimal&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-loop:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Main loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main loop begins with green lights for the cars. In this state the button for the pedestrian crossing is checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/StefanScherer/docker-rpi-traffic-light/raw/master/pedestrian-crossing.py?slice=49:64&amp;footer=minimal&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pedestrian-crossing:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Pedestrian crossing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the button has been pressed the next code block just changes the LEDs for the cars to red, green for pedestrians and back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/StefanScherer/docker-rpi-traffic-light/raw/master/pedestrian-crossing.py?slice=64:&amp;footer=minimal&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That completes the whole app. I could explain how a traffic light works and my daughter could play with it for a while. This could be the whole story, but as I&amp;rsquo;ve deployed my app with Docker there is another story behind the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;dockerize-all-the-things:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Dockerize all the things&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to save my work and make it reproducible for me and others. So beside putting the source code into a GitHub repo I also dockerized the application development and deployment. With the help of Docker and the Docker tools it is very easy to develop from eg. a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after months and other projects it is easy to spin up that application again as there is a standardized way. There also is no need to backup the SD image and write down what you had to install on your Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/traffic-light/mac_rpi_development.png&#34; alt=&#34;Developing for RPi from a Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the diagram your Notebook should have the following tools installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/flash&#34;&gt;flash tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to flash the SD card image with HypriotOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/&#34;&gt;Docker Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to build a secured connection to the Raspberry Pi Docker Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/&#34;&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to easily start dockerized apps with a single command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker Client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to run other Docker commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t get into the details on how to connect your Notebook with the Docker Engine on the Raspberry Pi. This is part of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/post/how-to-setup-rpi-docker-swarm/&#34;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; how to use docker-machine for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dockerfile:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the Docker image we need a Dockerfile. We use a Python base image and install the needed tools and dependencies. Then we add the application source code and define the command to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/StefanScherer/docker-rpi-traffic-light/raw/master/Dockerfile?footer=minimal&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-compose-yml:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker Compose can be used to simplify running the container. With the docker-compose.yml we can document all the parameters needed to start the container. The file is versioned in Git so we do not forget how to run this container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist-it.appspot.com/github/StefanScherer/docker-rpi-traffic-light/raw/master/docker-compose.yml?footer=minimal&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;developing-the-app:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Developing the app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you develop the app or want to modify the source code the Docker image has to be rebuilt with the new code. To do this just run this command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-the-app:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Running the app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to stop the app again, just press &lt;code&gt;CTRL+C&lt;/code&gt;. You may have to press it twice to kill the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-permanently:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Running permanently&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run the application automatically by adding &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt;. The docker-compose.yml also sets the restart policy to always, so the container is starting right after booting the Raspberry Pi. This is very useful for such hardware projects which should start automatically after turning on your Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to stop the app again, just use this command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose kill
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-the-dockerized-app:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Sharing the dockerized app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of using Docker is to easily share the dockerized app with others. As the developer of an app you just push the Docker image with to the Docker Hub. Others can pull this Docker image from there and run it without to know which tools and dependencies to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/traffic-light/mac_rpi_docker_push.png&#34; alt=&#34;Developing for RPi from a Mac&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pushing-the-docker-image:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Pushing the Docker image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker images
docker tag dockerrpitrafficlight_trafficlight stefanscherer/rpi-traffic-light
docker push stefanscherer/rpi-traffic-light
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker image is send sent to the Docker Hub. My example is available as image &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/rpi-traffic-light/&#34;&gt;stefanscherer/rpi-traffic-light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-with-others:36e2dfd970af1a18eb3decac8ff94950&#34;&gt;Sharing with Others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone else wants to build the traffic light and run your application, she has to use this little modified docker-compose.yml to pull the published Docker image instead of building it herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;version: &#39;2&#39;
services:
  trafficlight:
    image: stefanscherer/rpi-traffic-light
    devices:
      - &amp;quot;/dev/mem:/dev/mem&amp;quot;
    cap_add:
      - SYS_RAWIO
    restart: always
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then run the application with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose up -d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or use the docker command with all the parameters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm --cap-add SYS_RAWIO --device /dev/mem stefanscherer/rpi-traffic-light
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command pulls the Docker image from the Docker hub if it isn&amp;rsquo;t available locally on the Raspberry Pi. After that it runs a Docker container with the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way any app can be published in the same way, regardless the programming language used.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/how-to-setup-rpi-docker-swarm/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This week is dedicated to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/swarmweek-join-your-first-swarm/&#34;&gt;Docker #SwarmWeek&lt;/a&gt;. In this tutorial we show you how easy it is to setup a Docker Swarm with HypriotOS and the standard &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/how-to-setup-rpi-docker-swarm/docker-swarm-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Docker Swarm&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to setup a cluster with &lt;strong&gt;eight Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/strong&gt;, grouped into two tiny datacenters with four Pi&amp;rsquo;s each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prepare-your-notebook:7086adb18de3c46a0c9331e9b3dc5f01&#34;&gt;Prepare your notebook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To control the Docker Swarm from our notebook, we have to install both &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; binaries. If you are on a Mac, you can use &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; to install them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;brew install docker
brew install docker-machine
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;flash-all-your-sd-cards:7086adb18de3c46a0c9331e9b3dc5f01&#34;&gt;Flash all your SD cards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can easily flash the latest HypriotOS image to the eight SD cards with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/flash#installation&#34;&gt;flash tool&lt;/a&gt; and assign different node names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;flash --hostname swarm-dc1-pi01 https://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriot-rpi-20160306-192317.img.zip
flash --hostname swarm-dc1-pi02 https://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriot-rpi-20160306-192317.img.zip
...
flash --hostname swarm-dc2-pi04 https://downloads.hypriot.com/hypriot-rpi-20160306-192317.img.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, insert the SD cards and boot all the Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;prepare-your-pi-s-for-docker-machine:7086adb18de3c46a0c9331e9b3dc5f01&#34;&gt;Prepare your Pi&amp;rsquo;s for docker-machine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to create the Docker Swarm with the standard &lt;code&gt;docker-machine&lt;/code&gt; binary. To make this work we need to prepare the Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s a little bit. The next steps are adding your SSH public key to all of your Pi&amp;rsquo;s as well as fixing the ID in &lt;code&gt;/etc/os-release&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;debian&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;function getip() { (traceroute $1 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 | head -n 1 | cut -d\( -f 2 | cut -d\) -f 1) }

IP_ADDRESS=$(getip swarm-dc1-pi01.local)

ssh-keygen -R $IP_ADDRESS
ssh-copy-id -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oCheckHostIP=no root@$IP_ADDRESS

ssh root@$IP_ADDRESS sed -i \&#39;s/ID=raspbian/ID=debian/g\&#39; /etc/os-release
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat this for all the eight Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s. You will prompted for the root password which is &lt;code&gt;hypriot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-swarm-token:7086adb18de3c46a0c9331e9b3dc5f01&#34;&gt;Create Swarm Token&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Docker Swarm cluster uses a unique Cluster ID to enable all swarm agents find each other. We need such a Cluster ID to build our Docker Swarm. This can be done in your shell with this command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;export TOKEN=$(for i in $(seq 1 32); do echo -n $(echo &amp;quot;obase=16; $(($RANDOM % 16))&amp;quot; | bc); done; echo)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-the-swarm-with-docker-machine:7086adb18de3c46a0c9331e9b3dc5f01&#34;&gt;Create the swarm with docker-machine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now create the Swarm Master on the first Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;docker-machine create -d generic \
  --engine-storage-driver=overlay --swarm --swarm-master \
  --swarm-image hypriot/rpi-swarm:latest \
  --swarm-discovery=&amp;quot;token://$TOKEN&amp;quot; \
  --generic-ip-address=$(getip swarm-dc1-pi01.local) \
  swarm-dc1-pi01
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the seven remaining Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s we create Swarm Agents that join the Swarm cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;docker-machine create -d generic \
  --engine-storage-driver=overlay --swarm \
  --swarm-image hypriot/rpi-swarm:latest \
  --swarm-discovery=&amp;quot;token://$TOKEN&amp;quot; \
  --generic-ip-address=$(getip swarm-dc1-pi02.local) \
  swarm-dc1-pi02
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while the whole Docker Swarm cluster with the two datacenters is up and running. We now have a cluster with &lt;strong&gt;32 CPU&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;8 GByte RAM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;control-your-swarm:7086adb18de3c46a0c9331e9b3dc5f01&#34;&gt;Control your Swarm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect to your Docker Swarm use the following command to set the environment variables for the Docker Client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;eval $(docker-machine env --swarm swarm-dc1-pi01)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve just prepared a new beta release of HypriotOS 0.7.0 Berry which is based upon an updated 0.6.1 Hector. Feel free to check it out: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/&#34;&gt;http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/hypriotos-berry-rpi3/IMG_0763.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Raspberry Pi 3&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basic support for Raspberry Pi 3 B (internal WiFi/BT is currently not supported)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux kernel 4.1.17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Engine 1.10.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker Compose 1.6.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swarm 1.1.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This SD image still works on all available Raspberry Pi models (really!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We included all the latest Docker tools for you and especially the new Docker Swarm 1.1.3. Together with the brand-new powerful Raspberry Pi 3 B it makes to much fun to run Docker containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget, this week is Docker &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SwarmWeek?src=hash&#34;&gt;#SwarmWeek&lt;/a&gt;. Head over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/swarmweek-is-coming/&#34;&gt;https://blog.docker.com/2016/02/swarmweek-is-coming/&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with the help of Docker Swarm it’s just awesome to control a fleet of Raspberry Pi’s running your awesome distributed applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Run Docker on a Raspberry Pi 3 with onboard WiFi</title>
      <link>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/run-docker-rpi3-with-wifi/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2016 16:04:12 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.hypriot.com/post/run-docker-rpi3-with-wifi/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Today morning we finally got our Raspberry Pi 3&amp;rsquo;s from ThePiHut. They have been overwhelmed by the number of orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/rpi3-onboard-wifi/thepihut-delivery.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ThePiHut delivery&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the delivery we already heard from our community that the current HypriotOS SD image does not boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with some little tweaks the first people have started running Docker containers with HypriotOS. We will update our image builder soon and publish a new HypriotOS image for an easy out-of-the-box experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime for all the impatient out there I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a short intro how to run the latest Docker Engine on the standard Raspbian SD image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;download-raspbian-lite:41cd8e8b967fec6fd9b7dfd6fb7de44e&#34;&gt;Download Raspbian LITE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just download and flash the Raspbian LITE image from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/&#34;&gt;https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/&lt;/a&gt; or use our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/flash&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;flash&lt;/code&gt; script&lt;/a&gt; with this command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;flash https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now boot your Raspberry Pi 3 and log into it with user &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt; and the password &lt;code&gt;raspberry&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard Raspbian image does not resize the SD filesystem automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-the-overlay-kernel-module:41cd8e8b967fec6fd9b7dfd6fb7de44e&#34;&gt;Add the overlay kernel module&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we resize and reboot the Pi we also customize a little bit. The overlay kernel module must be loaded automatically while booting, so we just add it with the next command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;echo &amp;quot;overlay&amp;quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;customize-wifi:41cd8e8b967fec6fd9b7dfd6fb7de44e&#34;&gt;Customize WiFi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to run your Docker with the onboard WiFi, just add your SSID and pre-shared key with the next command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;echo &#39;network={
  ssid=&amp;quot;your-ssid&amp;quot;
  psk=&amp;quot;your-psk&amp;quot;
}&#39; | sudo tee -a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resize-filesystem:41cd8e8b967fec6fd9b7dfd6fb7de44e&#34;&gt;Resize filesystem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have to resize the filesystem to install Docker and have space for Docker images and containers. Start &lt;code&gt;raspi-config&lt;/code&gt; and follow the steps to resize your filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;sudo raspi-config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that let raspi-config reboot your Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cut-the-wires:41cd8e8b967fec6fd9b7dfd6fb7de44e&#34;&gt;Cut the wires&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have added your WiFi settings, remove your network cable while rebooting. From now on you can connect to your Raspberry Pi 3 over the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-docker:41cd8e8b967fec6fd9b7dfd6fb7de44e&#34;&gt;Install Docker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After rebooting, eventually unplugging the network cable we have to install Docker. The Raspbian Jessie distribution also has a Docker package, but it is only Version 1.3.3. So we install the Hypriot&amp;rsquo;s Docker 1.10.2 instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just log into your Raspberry Pi 3 again and install Docker with these commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
wget -q https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
echo &#39;deb https://packagecloud.io/Hypriot/Schatzkiste/debian/ wheezy main&#39; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hypriot.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-hypriot
sudo systemctl enable docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have a good setup until the next HypriotOS release is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/rpi3-onboard-wifi/rpi3-raspbian-lite-docker-version.png&#34; alt=&#34;docker version&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with the onboard WiFi it is now very easy to build some mobile Docker IoT projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.hypriot.com/images/rpi3-onboard-wifi/rpi3-over-the-air.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;docker over the air&#34; /&gt;
