      <title>Testing High Availability of Docker Swarm on a Raspberry Pi Cluster (Updated)</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In its release in June this year, Docker announced two exciting news about the Docker Engine: First, the Engine 1.12 comes with built-in high availability features, called &amp;ldquo;Docker Swarm Mode&amp;rdquo;. And second, Docker started providing official support for the ARM architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two news combined beg for testing the new capabilities in reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/high-availability-testing/high-availability-docker-swarm.png&#34; alt=&#34;SwarmClusterHA&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Docker Swarm already offered some high availability features, but the new called &amp;ldquo;Swarm Mode&amp;rdquo; goes far beyond: To me, the most important capabilities to mention are: built-in security, rolling updates and - maybe one of the most important benefits - super user-friendliness. Production ready clustering based on powerful container technology has probably never been easier before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the release of Docker 1.12 comes with official support for the ARM architecture. Running Docker on ARM has been possible for long time, but now, users can install it the same way on their Raspberry Pis as they do it on any other architecture: Using Docker&amp;rsquo;s official repositories. If you are one of our regular readers, you know that our Team at Hypriot intensively collaborated with Docker to make this official support possible. So we are also very happy that this huge milestone that many people asked for is eventually checked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with these two news, let&amp;rsquo;s get our hands dirty and test if the announced promises hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup-the-cluster:a00c34eb72f8a894fd7d46707edd473e&#34;&gt;Setup the cluster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As hardware&lt;/strong&gt;, I have 5x Raspberry Pi 3, connected in a network with Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pis with their SD cards, the network switch, power input and all cables live in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.picocluster.com/collections/starter-picocluster-kits/products/pico-5-raspberry-pi-starter-kit?variant=29344698892&#34;&gt;hardware kit from PicoCluster&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to PicoCluster for providing the kit to us for testing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how the cluster looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/high-availability-testing/PicoCluster.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PicoClusterBuilt&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As software&lt;/strong&gt;, I chose HypriotOS. I also tried Raspbian, but it requires a large system upgrade after the first boot in order to provide all features required by Docker (e.g. VXLAN kernel module). Before and after the system upgrade, I also had to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/contrib/check-config.sh&#34;&gt;Docker&amp;rsquo;s test script&lt;/a&gt; to make sure everything is ok. All of this is not a big deal, but if there is an OS available that comes out of the box with all that Docker needs (and even adds lots of useful optimizations), it simply saves time and provides a hassle-free experience. So I flashed all SD cards with HypriotOS using our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/flash&#34;&gt;flash tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To connect to the cluster&lt;/strong&gt;, I SSHed into all the nodes via &lt;a href=&#34;http://gnometerminator.blogspot.de/p/introduction.html&#34;&gt;Terminator&lt;/a&gt;. Terminator is my preferred tool to organize multiple terminals in a single window. It allows to send commands to several terminals at once. Soon, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a look at tmux and might switch, but for now I recommend Terminator :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have 5 terminals opened, all waiting for commands as you see in the following image. Please don&amp;rsquo;t care about the commands running in each terminal for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/high-availability-testing/terminal.png&#34; alt=&#34;Terminator&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all to do before getting our hands on Docker itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup-docker-swarm-on-the-cluster:a00c34eb72f8a894fd7d46707edd473e&#34;&gt;Setup Docker Swarm on the cluster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On latest HypriotOS, you&amp;rsquo;ll have the latest Docker installed, so we can instantly start playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an arbitrary node of the cluster, run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker swarm init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output should look similar to that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Swarm initialized: current node (node-master) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-1acm9qa7b0hmzz5v8t40d75v5fsgckeu2z5ds6ls0x7cny7l8p-307wqrc8756akpxjxls9abbbs \
    [2a02:810d:8600:2a78:f6c6:d67d:6912:17ca]:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run &#39;docker swarm join-token manager&#39; and follow the instructions.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in this output, now you need to run the presented &lt;code&gt;docker swarm join ...&lt;/code&gt; command on all other nodes, which you want to join the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the node at which you executed &lt;code&gt;docker swarm init&lt;/code&gt;, check if all nodes of your cluster successfully formed a swarm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker node ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the terminal prints a list of all nodes of your cluster, the setup is all done! Forming a cluster cannot be easier, can it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;execution-of-tests:a00c34eb72f8a894fd7d46707edd473e&#34;&gt;Execution of tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tests of Docker&amp;rsquo;s ability to recover from failures comprise the following use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ethernet interface of a random node (master or slave) got unavailable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random node completely rebooted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random node instantly crashed (unplug power source)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I documented one of the test runs in the following screencast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/185361173&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/185361173&#34;&gt;Testing High Availability Docker Swarm Mode&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/user54109827&#34;&gt;Mathias Renner&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;results:a00c34eb72f8a894fd7d46707edd473e&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the screencast, Docker is able to recover from failure of the ethernet interface. After testing the other use cases later on, Docker recovered flawlessly from a reboot and crash as well. This holds for the slave and the master node, which is remarkable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit on 6.11.2016&lt;/strong&gt;: Jérémy Derussé and Nikolay Kushin reported in the discussion below that for them a reboot or crash of a node did not result in a healthy cluster state after bringing up the node again. As of today, unfortunately I can confirm this, with Docker version 1.12.1, 1.12.2 as well as 1.12.3. I cannot explain why during my tests for this post a crashed node recovered smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s report, I was able to create a quick fix for this issue. On a node, simply run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;sudo crontab -e&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, insert the following line (without quotation marks) and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;@reboot docker ps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having this configured, after a crash or reboot the node recovered correctly in my tests. I look forward for feedback about this issue! Please use the discussion below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-to-come-soon:a00c34eb72f8a894fd7d46707edd473e&#34;&gt;More to come soon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is only a small chunk of the data I gathered during the tests. The next option to get the details is during my talk at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://highload.co/&#34;&gt;HighLoad++ Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Moskow, Russia. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy if you can make it there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this is not the end of the story of course. Thorough testing requires also measuring incoming requests from an external load tester to the cluster while a failure occurs. After some research, I have not found any evidence that someone has ever performed that tests (please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Kubernetes received much attention lately since its support for ARM became better and better. So wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be interesting to see if Docker or Kubernetes is better in keeping a service available and performing well, even if there are outages in the cluster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s more coming soon, just stay tuned for the upcoming posts :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning about Cloud Computing with Hypriot Cluster Lab at ICT 2016</title>
      <link>https://blog.hypriot.com/post/talk_ict_2016_international_conference_telecommunications/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Our cooperation with University of Bamberg pays off once again: We had the chance to present our Hypriot Cluster Lab at &lt;a href=&#34;http://ict-2016.org/&#34;&gt;ICT 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the International Conference on Telecommunications. There, we were able to show the Hypriot Cluster Lab to the attendees, who were mainly scientific researchers from all over the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/ict-2016-greece/ict_logo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IoT-requirements&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built the Hypriot Cluster Lab as lab environment that allows to easily teach about clustering and cloud computing. At the conference, the Hypriot Cluster Lab piqued lots of interest, so we are confident that it will be used more and more in educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after the show, we are publishing &lt;a href=&#34;http://ict-2016.org/pdf/Demo1.pdf&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; that has been accepted at the conference and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/ict-2016-greece/ICT-Presentation.pdf&#34;&gt;presentation slides&lt;/a&gt;. However, the paper is (intentionally) very brief and the slides are not throughout self-explanatory, so we&amp;rsquo;ve also written down what we&amp;rsquo;ve presented to the audience back in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iot-requires-expansion-to-small:e2e346a019a074ac80ebae91f71aeae5&#34;&gt;IoT requires &amp;ldquo;Expansion to small&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building cloud computing infrastructures with big servers is well understood. Even large cloud infrastructures powered by container technology are commonly in use. One of the pioneers to mention here is Google with its container-based cloud platform &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the uprising Internet of Things (IoT) will not allow to equip the edge of the network such as sensor networks in smart home/grid/production environments with big servers only. There, you especially need small devices with less computational power and energy demand. These devices require to be small and cheap enough to install up to several thousands of them in a smart environment, thereby creating sensor networks. For example think of sensor networks on wind farms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/ict-2016-greece/wind.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IoT-requirements&#34; /&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;padding-left:34.4em; font-size: smaller&#34;&gt;Image courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/ewea/16577911487/in/photolist-rfW8w8-ipD2tM-ipC49q-7d8FqR-ipCNzR-ipC1dU-ipBRBC-ipCGWN-ipCkFm-njeuG6-ipCC31-ipCnPv-ayYLge-ipCJ61-ayYMmc-ipBGVN-ayYHLH-9mZuNi-ayYMzX-oWbzp6-ayYK6n-7ZaHBQ-q8T7wm-az2p4W-8LowiB-az2o8s-ayYJJt-az2p2f-3euhCb-ayYMWD-ayYNgZ-ayYL48-az2riu-6YiWvR-az2qkC-ayYMev-az2rxU-az2on1-ayYK2V-ayYHrz-az2oru-az2ov7-az2oeW-qQMUJN-auVRqy-az2oDm-ayYM8Z-i5kW85-ayYJTV-az2rCE&#34;&gt;European Wind Energy Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, Hypriot Cluster Lab (HCL) comes into play:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HCL is a proof of concept that building clusters using container technology (in our case: Docker) also works well on small devices, not only on big servers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Expansion to Small&amp;rdquo; was the theme of the ICT 2016, which made HCL a perfect fit to the conference&amp;rsquo;s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hcl-makes-a-tangible-iot-like-cluster-affordable:e2e346a019a074ac80ebae91f71aeae5&#34;&gt;HCL makes a tangible IoT-like cluster affordable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HCL is not only a proof of concept that clustering with container technology on IoT devices works, it also serves a second purpose: It is cheap enough to be used as a learning platform to play with clustering or cloud computing on your desk. The minimal hardware configuration requires three Raspberry Pis plus accessoires, which is affordable for everyone to get their hands on a real, tangible cluster. We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen lecturers, students and pupils getting started on the HCL with different topics related to cloud computing, e.g. playing with micro services or load balancing. Some use cases can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hypriot/rpi-cluster-lab-demos&#34;&gt;in one of our repos here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the HCL is intended to be used as a tool to learn, its containing concepts are applicable for promising IoT software solutions. Comparing IoT&amp;rsquo;s general requirements for hard- and software that I identified in my bachelor thesis (&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@mathiasrenner/docker-container-virtualization-and-the-internet-of-things-bachelor-thesis-a6bc783b81fa#.f09czsq2e&#34;&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;) show that many of those aspects are already visible in the HCL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.hypriot.com/images/ict-2016-greece/iot-requirements.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IoT-requirements&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:e2e346a019a074ac80ebae91f71aeae5&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the conference was an enriching experience. Discussing with scientific researches and professors from many different countries resulted in high-grade feedback and inspirations of how we can further improve the HCL. Particularly interesting were the discussions after some glasses of good, greek wine. They resulted in less high-grade feedback, but much fun instead :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we look forward to attend more conferences. Well, the next conference is already set: In two weeks, three of the Hypriot team (Dieter, Stefan and myself) will attend DockerCon in Seattle, USA! We will give workshops and talks, so we are happy to meet you there! For everyone who won&amp;rsquo;t attend: Stay tuned, we try to share as much as possible via our channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I give special thanks Marcel Großmann (research assistant at University of Bamberg) for his great support. He is not only providing high quality feedback to our work, meanwhile he also contributes to the HCL. Not to mention that he also provides the venue for our Docker Meetups. His continunous support is worth a virtual applause!&lt;/p&gt;
