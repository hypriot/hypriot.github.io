No, it’s because <em>Jessie</em> is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/debian-8-linuxs-most-reliable-distro-makes-its-biggest-change-since-1993/">the next version of the Debian operating system</a> that forms the foundation of our SD card image.</p>

        <p>Within the blogging community static site generators have been an exceptional hot topic in the last couple of years (at least before Docker appeared).
There are even <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">whole projects</a> dedicated to giving an overview of the most popular static site generators.</p>

<p>One of the first static site generators that got really popular was <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/commits/master">Jekyll</a>, which was conceived by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> of Github fame.
Typically static site generators transform input (e.g. text in a lightweight markup language such as Markdown or reStructuredText) to static HTML with the help of templates and filters.</p>

HTTP requests will be distributed to these Node.js nodes by an HAProxy instance running on another Docker container.</p>

<p>The positive feedback we received and the fact that two days later Docker 1.5.0 was released did motivate us to create an improved version of our Get-Docker-Up-And-Running-On-Your-Pi-In-No-Time SD card image.</p>

        If you have not been living under a rock last week you probably heard that the Raspberry Pi Foundation did release a second generation Raspberry Pi on the 2th of February. The last generation being a huge success with 4 million devices sold at the end of 2014 the success story is likely to continue with a new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B in 2015. Pi 2 has the same form factor as the previous Pi 1 Model B+ and is completely compatible with Pi 1 - which is good news for everybody who already owns a Pi 1.
