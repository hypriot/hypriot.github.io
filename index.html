            The Pine A64 is about to become the cheapest ARM 64-bit platform to run Docker
          </a>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 25, 2016</span>

        <p><img src="/images/pine-a64/close_up_front_pine_06.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Last Saturday one of the more promising <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pine64/pine-a64-first-15-64-bit-single-board-super-comput">Kickstarter campaigns</a>
that piqued our curiosity ended after 44 days and was able to raise <strong>1.7 million dollars</strong>.
It was a campaign to fund the cheapest 64-bit ARM board that can currently be bought for money.</p>

<p><strong>The Pine A64 sells for 15 bucks</strong>.</p>

<p>So why is that noteworthy when there are boards like the Pi Zero around that sell for $5?</p>

<p>It very much is, when you put that price into perspective. The cheapest 64-bit ARM board we knew before the Pine was
the <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/getting-docker-running-on-a-highend-arm-gaming-console-for-fun-and-profit/">NVIDIA ShieldTV</a>, which sells for about $200.
Next comes the much more expensive <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/amd-starts-shipping-seattle-arm-server-chips-14423259/">AMD Opteron A1100 series</a> where an individual chip alone starts with a price tag of $150.</p>

<p>All in all that means that the Pine A64 is the most affordable way to lay your hands on real 64-bit ARM hardware - and that by a long shot!
So what can you actually do with such a device?</p>

        <p>It all began when Dieter aka <a href="https://twitter.com/Quintus23M">@Quintus23M</a> started to experiment with the NVIDIA ShieldTV.
The ShieldTV is a curious little thing. Sold as a media hub for your living room it does deliver one teraflop of processing power.
On top of that it is one of the first 64-bit ARM boards that can be bought for a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Regular readers of our blog know that it is not in Dieter&rsquo;s nature to resist the Sirens voices of such an appealing beauty for long.

        <p><strong>An introduction to Docker, hands-on tutorials, live demos and roughly 30 attendees.</strong></p>

<p>This is the summary of the first Docker meetup that we organized in cooperation with University of Bamberg. As a supplement to this event yesterday, we share the pictures and the slides of the presentation.</p>

            How to compile Go on any ARM device

        </h1>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 31, 2015</span>

        <p>As for today, up to the latest Go version 1.5.2 there is no official binary release
of the Go runtime available for ARM devices. Maybe you can install it as
a package from your operating system, but these packages are almost outdated.</p>

<p>For this reason, anyone who wants to use GOLANG (or Go for short) on an ARM device has to compile
it by himself. This is a cumbersome and time consuming task, which sometimes leads
to bad results.</p>

<p>To cover these issues, we&rsquo;ll explain in this short and basic tutorial how to compile
and test the Go compiler runtime by yourself. We&rsquo;d like to cover all the details you&rsquo;ll
need from the ground up. And with having this basic understanding then it&rsquo;s easier
for everybody to build and use the Go compiler in a consistent and reproducible way.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started with building your own Go environment on ARM&hellip;</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 28, 2015</span>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t really know how this happened. Again. :(<br />
Somehow over and over again these little ARM devices and maker devboards end up on my desk.</p>

<p>So what is it this time?</p>

<p>Well, look at this beauty because words cannot even begin to describe it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/nvidia-shieldtv/docker-on-nvidia-shieldtv.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Alright, start breathing again.</p>

<p>It is called the <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com">Nvidia ShieldTV</a> and it&rsquo;s meant to be a media center.
Besides, it is one of the first Android gaming consoles that actually is worthy of the name.</p>

<p>It would be a really great Christmas present for my son. But that is purely hypothetical and he is totally out of luck here.</p>

<p>Why? Well, because the Nvidia Tegra X1 CPU is one of the first <strong>64-bit ARM CPU&rsquo;s</strong> that can be bought <strong>now</strong> and it is even <strong>affordable</strong> with a price tag well under 200 bucks.</p>

<p>Being both Dieter and part of the Hypriot crew it should be clear now where this is heading, right?
As you all know Docker pirates love to be ARMed with little explosive stuff - and it doesn&rsquo;t get more explosive than the Nvidia ShieldTV.</p>

<p>So my son won&rsquo;t get to play any games soon because <strong>I need</strong> to get Docker running on this little beauty.
A device engineered for performance and made to game. So, let&rsquo;s start playing&hellip;</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 8, 2015</span>

        <p>Today we wanna share something with you that we have been working on for the last couple of weeks. And we are pretty exited about it, too.
It is based on our beloved <a href="http://blog.hypriot.com/post/get-your-all-in-one-docker-playground-now-hypriotos-reloaded/">HypriotOS</a> and makes it dead simple to build Docker clusters.</p>

<p>Until now it was not exactly easy to get started with Docker clustering.
You would have needed specific knowledge and lots of time to manually configure the cluster and its individual nodes.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s now a thing of the past.</p>

<p>May we introduce to you the newest member of the Hypriot family: <strong>The Hypriot Cluster Lab!</strong></p>

        <p>Today we are proud to present a guest contribution from the community. Marcel Großmann, a research assistant at the University of Bamberg, Germany, shows in a short test that the hardware family on which our ARMed Docker runs is probably much larger than we ever thought.

We are really happy that we were able to finish our new release called &ldquo;Hector&rdquo; just in time for DockerCon EU.</p>

<p>If you like a personal demo of what&rsquo;s in store for &ldquo;Hector&rdquo; just ping @Quintus23M on Twitter and meet him in person at DockerCon EU.
Dieter and Andreas brought their treasure chest filled with Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s to Barcelona and are eager to show off a bit.</p>

        <p>The great ARMed flood has begun. Especially for the sake of the IoT, every day new tiny devices pop up all around the world. And since most of these devices are build on top of the ARM architecture, with each new device, ARM gets more important compared to the x86 architecture proposed by Intel/AMD. Maybe you even need to run your next app on ARM! Thus better be prepared and port apps to ARM, it&rsquo;s basically just one step to take.</p>

        <p>In this blog post we show you how easy it is to install Swarm on your Raspberry Pi and how to set up a Raspberry Pi Swarm cluster with the help of Docker Machine.</p>

<p>We have built a little &ldquo;Pi Tower&rdquo; with three Raspberry Pi 2 model B and combined them into a Docker Swarm cluster.</p>

        <p>Within the blogging community static site generators have been an exceptional hot topic in the last couple of years (at least before Docker appeared).
There are even <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">whole projects</a> dedicated to giving an overview of the most popular static site generators.</p>

<p>One of the first static site generators that got really popular was <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/commits/master">Jekyll</a>, which was conceived by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> of Github fame.
Typically static site generators transform input (e.g. text in a lightweight markup language such as Markdown or reStructuredText) to static HTML with the help of templates and filters.</p>

HTTP requests will be distributed to these Node.js nodes by an HAProxy instance running on another Docker container.</p>

It allowed people to get up and running with Docker on the Raspberry Pi in no time.</p>

<p>The positive feedback we received and the fact that two days later Docker 1.5.0 was released did motivate us to create an improved version of our Get-Docker-Up-And-Running-On-Your-Pi-In-No-Time SD card image.</p>

        If you have not been living under a rock last week you probably heard that the Raspberry Pi Foundation did release a second generation Raspberry Pi on the 2th of February. The last generation being a huge success with 4 million devices sold at the end of 2014 the success story is likely to continue with a new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B in 2015. Pi 2 has the same form factor as the previous Pi 1 Model B+ and is completely compatible with Pi 1 - which is good news for everybody who already owns a Pi 1.
