            Fix Dirty COW on Raspberry Pi the Docker way

        </h1>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 1, 2016</span>

        <p>Have you seen the latest reports about the Linux kernel security vulnerability called &ldquo;Dirty COW&rdquo;?
Dirty COW is a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/21/linux_privilege_escalation_hole/">race condition in Linux</a> arising from how Copy-On-Write (the COW in the name) is handled by the kernel&rsquo;s memory subsystem&rsquo;s use of private mappings.</p>

<p>The really dangerous point here is, it can be used to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/01/docker_user_havent_patched_dirty_cow_yet_bad_news/">escape Docker containers</a>.
<img src="/images/fix-dirty-cow-on-raspberry-pi/dirty-cow-001.jpg" alt="dirty-cow-001" />
</p>

<p>So, we&rsquo;re encourage you to immediately fix it with upgrading your Linux kernel on the Raspberry Pi !!!</p>

<p>No matter if you&rsquo;re running an official Raspbian or HypriotOS, please upgrade your Linux kernel to be safe again&hellip;</p>

        <p>At home I use some Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s for some home network services, and I run
these services inside Docker containers. From time to time I want to see or
manage one of these containers. But I&rsquo;m too lazy to get to my laptop and use
the Docker CLI for that. There are two nice Docker UI&rsquo;s to access your Docker engine with a web browser. Let&rsquo;s have a look at both.</p>

        </h1>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 26, 2016</span>

        <p>In its release in June this year, Docker announced two exciting news about the Docker Engine: First, the Engine 1.12 comes with built-in high availability features, called &ldquo;Docker Swarm Mode&rdquo;. And second, Docker started providing official support for the ARM architecture.</p>

<p>These two news combined beg for testing the new capabilities in reality.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Sep 4, 2016</span>

        <p>With the new SwarmMode in Docker 1.12 it is really damn easy to build a Docker Swarm and connect different ARM devices to an IoT cluster.</p>

<p><img src="/images/deploy-swarm-on-chip-with-docker-machine/swarm-chip-flashing1.jpg" alt="swarm-chip-flashing1.jpg" />
</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s connect a few of the $9 C.H.I.P. computers and a Raspberry Pi Zero all through a WiFi network&hellip;</p>

        <p>Did you see the successfully launch of a really cheap ARM board for $9 only - the C.H.I.P. computer? It has an ARMv7 CPU with 512 MByte of main memory, 4 GByte flash memory as disk storage and is equipped with onboard WiFi and bluetooth as well.
<img src="/images/install-docker-on-chip-computer/chip-and-banana.jpg" alt="chip-and-banana" />
</p>

<p>With these awesome features built-in it would be really a great device to run Docker containers if only the recent Linux kernel 4.4  has the correct modules included, but it doesn&rsquo;t - what a bummer!</p>

<p>But with spending a lot of time in building a custom Linux kernel and tweaking &amp; testing I was finally able to install the latest Docker Engine for ARM on the C.H.I.P. &mdash; and as a result you can easily follow this tutorial and within a few minutes only you can run your first Docker container on this cute ARM board&hellip;</p>

<p>For this major release we&rsquo;ve taken an especially great deal of trouble. Out of the box, you not only get the breaking features of the Docker Engine 1.12.1 and the latest versions of Docker Compose and Docker Machine, but also many improvements that enhance the performance, reliability and usability.</p>

        <p>Over time many of our users have asked us exactly how we build the Docker Engine
and the associated Debian packages. For instance: they&rsquo;d like to hack on some
 new features and need the latest software releases as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Here I&rsquo;ll share all the details on building the latest Docker version - even on
a Raspberry Pi itself. Beware: while it&rsquo;s not too complicated it will require
a large amount of time!</p>

        <p>In the last couple of days there were some users on our Gitter channel having problems accessing their Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s with HypriotOS via Docker Machine.
As we have not yet written how that works I thought I would do a short blog post on how to use Docker Machine with HypriotOS.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not all. Yesterday when I watched the DockerCon Keynote Livestream of the new Docker orchestration I wondered how Docker Machine and the new orchestration would work together.</p>

<p>So just for the fun of it I decided I will explore that a bit, too.</p>

        <p>A couple of days ago I wrote a <a href="/post/microservices-bliss-with-docker-and-traefik/">blog post</a> about how easy it is to get a microservice application up and running with Docker and a HTTP proxy called Traefik.
I explained how awesome Traefik is because it makes complex setups with HAProxy, Registrator, Consul, etc. a thing of the past.</p>

<p>I really thought it couldn&rsquo;t get much easier. Oh boy - was I wrong!</p>

<p>Today as part of the Docker opening keynote Docker demostrated an evolution of Docker Swarm that simplifies this whole scenario even more.
It makes setting up a Docker Swarm Cluster a really simple and straigtforward task.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this new thing works&hellip;</p>

        <p>Last Saturday Germany&rsquo;s biggest Raspberry Pi community event - <a href="http://piandmore.de/en">the PiAndMore</a> - took place for the 9th time.</p>

<p>In cooperation with the University of Trier the organizers were able to provide a broad range of activities.
There were talks, workshops and many interesting tinker projects at display to delight even the most demanding maker heart.</p>

<p>It comes as no suprise that Docker was a hot topic at the PiAndMore conference, too.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 7, 2016</span>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago I found this really nice and neat HTTP reverse proxy called <a href="https://docs.traefik.io/">Traefik</a>.
It is meant to act as frontend proxy for microservices that are provided by a dynamic backend like Docker.</p>

<p>Did you realize the important part of the last sentence was <strong>dynamic</strong>?</p>

<p>What makes Traefik really special is its ability of adding and removing container backend services by listening to Docker events.
So whenever a Docker container is started or stopped Traefik knows about it and adds the container to its list of active backend services.</p>

<p><img src="/images/traefik/architecture.png" alt="Traffic" />
</p>

<p>With this ability Traefik can replace much more complicated setups based on Nginx or HAProxy that have to use additional tools like
<a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator">Registrator</a>, <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template">Consul-Template</a> to achieve the same kind of functionality.</p>

<p>So let me show you with a simple microservice example how easy it is to get started with Traefik&hellip;</p>

<p>We have also moved every build step out in the cloud to use the &ldquo;programmable internet&rdquo; to build and test everything with just a <strong>git push</strong>.</p>

        <p>While it is quite hard to make something better that is already good, we feel that we were able to just do that with our latest release of HypriotOS.</p>

<p><strong>HypriotOS is the easiest and fastest way to get you started with Docker on ARM and IoT devices.</strong></p>

<p>It is the perfect playground for your first steps with Docker and it allows you to move to advanced stuff like Docker Clustering without breaking a sweat, too.</p>

<p>This is possible because we included a lot of the tools that make the Docker ecosystem awesome - for instance Docker Compose or Docker Swarm - out of the box.
We also integrated the Hypriot Cluster-Lab into this release, which makes it really easy and painless to set up complex Docker Clusters.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. So read on to get all the glory details of this new release &hellip; :)</p>

        <p>Besides our <a href="/downloads/">Download section</a> we do have another source for getting the latest and greatest Docker for ARM.<br />
It is a debian package repository hosted at <a href="https://packagecloud.io/">packagecloud.io</a> that contains lots of the stuff from our Download section.</p>

<p>Despite having a package repository for a couple of months now, it seems many people do not know it.
I guess that&rsquo;s our own fault because we never spoke about it - we only added it to our prepared SD card images. :)
Installing or updating Docker or other Docker goodies like Docker-Compose from this repository can be done by a simple <code>apt-get install</code>.</p>

<p>In this post I gonna show you what you need to know to get started with this repository.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 27, 2016</span>

        <p>A few days ago, Docker has announced a closed BETA program for their new
applications &ldquo;Docker for Mac&rdquo; and &ldquo;Docker for Windows&rdquo;. These apps are meant to
simplify the usage of Docker containers for every developer even more. They try
to lower the barrier to install and use Docker on your desktop and laptop computers
for both Mac and Windows users.</p>

<p>As soon as I received the first rumors that there is a special feature built-in,
which should also simplify the developers workflow for IoT applications, I was getting
totally thrilled and registered immediately for the BETA program. It was really hard
to wait for, but luckily I&rsquo;ve received an email with my BETA invitation and access
token within a few hours only.</p>

<p>Here I&rsquo;d like to give you a first insight view how to install and use &ldquo;Docker for Mac&rdquo;
with a basic walk-through on my MacBook Pro running the very latest OS X 10.11.4.</p>

        <p>As we love to use Docker Swarm on a cluster of Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;d like to cover
in this hands-on tutorial how to build such a cluster easily with a hardware kit
from <a href="http://picocluster.com">PicoCluster</a>.</p>

<p>All you need is a PicoCluster kit for a 3-node or 5-node cluster, a couple of
Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s and the time to assemble all the parts together. The project can be
completed within an hour only, and makes so much fun, too - especially when you can
share this as quality time with your kids.</p>

        <p>A week ago Scaleway announced their new C2 server. I was so excited to see that they were introducing new ARM C2 servers with 8 CPUs and 32 GB of RAM. Wow!
Not until I logged in and did <code>lscpu</code> did I realize that those servers were &ldquo;just&rdquo; Intel Atom servers.</p>

<p>A bit disappointed I thought what to do now? In my enthusiasm I had spun up 3 servers with 82 GB of RAM and 24 CPUs.
Still with my thoughts firmly rooted in the <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/swarmweek-join-your-first-swarm/">Docker #SwarmWeek</a> I could not resist to find out how easy it would be to set up a Swarm Cluster on those servers.</p>

<p>But a Swarm Cluster on its own is like a container ship without any containers - so I decided to run a Jenkins Cluster on top of the Swarm Cluster.</p>

<p>You might not believe me, but I was able to set up a 100 node Jenkins Cluster in less than 10 minutes.
And you can do that, too.</p>

        <p>A couple of weeks ago we have been invited by the fine folks over at the Docker User Group in Brussels to help conduct a workshop.
And of course this workshop was about Docker. Still it was not your ordinary Docker workshop.</p>

<p>It was special because instead of being a workshop about Docker on big servers it was about Docker on really small ARM devices.
The very same devices that power the upcoming IoT revolution.</p>

<p>Turns out it is really amazing what you can do with Docker on those tiny machines.</p>

        <p>Here is the follow up of our blog post series about the new ARM-based router board
from SolidRun which is powered by a dual core Marvell ARMADA ARMv7 CPU. In case
you missed the intro a few days ago, we highly recommend reading the technical

<li>Part 1: <a href="/post/introducing-the-clearfog-pro-router-board/">Introducing the new ClearFog Pro Router Board from SolidRun</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This time we&rsquo;ll get our hands on this new board and try to install Linux with a
recent kernel version and hopefully we&rsquo;re able to install and run the Docker Engine
the first time on this powerful device.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started and for our second episode we connect the ClearFog Pro to a
MacBookPro and powering this thing up&hellip;</p>

        <p>For many people it comes as a surprise that one can access all the hardware of an IoT device from within a Docker container.
Interestingly enough Docker is a perfect tool for managing and distributing IoT development and production environments.</p>

<p>To illustrate this use case we are going to create a Docker image that allows us to read the data from a temperature sensor.</p>

        <p>Could you imagine to run a standard Linux OS and your applications of choice securely
within Docker containers on a beefy WiFi router at home?</p>

<p>We think this will be possible soon with this new ARM-based router board from SolidRun.
Thus we&rsquo;ll spent a whole blog post series to install our Debian-based HypriotOS
and get Docker running on this Marvell ARMADA powered Single Board Computer (SBC).</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started and for our first episode in this series we&rsquo;ll dive deep into
the technical specifications of the ClearFog Pro in order to get to know this neat
little device.</p>

        <p>With the recent release of Docker 1.10.0 it is a good time to talk about <strong>Docker on ARM</strong>.
As many of you know our mission is to make Docker (and container technology) a first class citizen on ARM devices.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://blog.docker.com/2016/02/docker-1-10/">Docker 1.10.0</a> it is finally possible to build <strong>Docker for ARM</strong> from the offical Docker repository.</p>

<p>Mind you - not everything that works for x86 is possible for ARM yet, but quite a lot is already working today.
And it is a first important step towards offical support for Docker on ARM.</p>

<p>In this blog post I am going to walk you through all the steps that are needed to test, build and package Docker on ARM.
And as an extra bonus I am showing you how to do this on the most advanced ARM on-demand cloud-platform ever.</p>

<p>Last Saturday one of the more promising <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pine64/pine-a64-first-15-64-bit-single-board-super-comput">Kickstarter campaigns</a>
that piqued our curiosity ended after 44 days and was able to raise <strong>1.7 million dollars</strong>.
It was a campaign to fund the cheapest 64-bit ARM board that can currently be bought for money.</p>

<p><strong>The Pine A64 sells for 15 bucks</strong>.</p>

<p>So why is that noteworthy when there are boards like the Pi Zero around that sell for $5?</p>

<p>It very much is, when you put that price into perspective. The cheapest 64-bit ARM board we knew before the Pine was
the <a href="/post/getting-docker-running-on-a-highend-arm-gaming-console-for-fun-and-profit/">NVIDIA ShieldTV</a>, which sells for about $200.
Next comes the much more expensive <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/amd-starts-shipping-seattle-arm-server-chips-14423259/">AMD Opteron A1100 series</a> where an individual chip alone starts with a price tag of $150.</p>

<p>All in all that means that the Pine A64 is the most affordable way to lay your hands on real 64-bit ARM hardware - and that by a long shot!
So what can you actually do with such a device?</p>

        <p>It all began when Dieter aka <a href="https://twitter.com/Quintus23M">@Quintus23M</a> started to experiment with the NVIDIA ShieldTV.
The ShieldTV is a curious little thing. Sold as a media hub for your living room it does deliver one teraflop of processing power.
On top of that it is one of the first 64-bit ARM boards that can be bought for a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Regular readers of our blog know that it is not in Dieter&rsquo;s nature to resist the Sirens voices of such an appealing beauty for long.

            How to compile Go on any ARM device

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 31, 2015</span>

        <p>As for today, up to the latest Go version 1.5.2 there is no official binary release
of the Go runtime available for ARM devices. Maybe you can install it as
a package from your operating system, but these packages are almost outdated.</p>

<p>For this reason, anyone who wants to use GOLANG (or Go for short) on an ARM device has to compile
it by himself. This is a cumbersome and time consuming task, which sometimes leads
to bad results.</p>

<p>To cover these issues, we&rsquo;ll explain in this short and basic tutorial how to compile
and test the Go compiler runtime by yourself. We&rsquo;d like to cover all the details you&rsquo;ll
need from the ground up. And with having this basic understanding then it&rsquo;s easier
for everybody to build and use the Go compiler in a consistent and reproducible way.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started with building your own Go environment on ARM&hellip;</p>

        <p>I don&rsquo;t really know how this happened. Again. :(<br />
Somehow over and over again these little ARM devices and maker devboards end up on my desk.</p>

<p>So what is it this time?</p>

<p>Well, look at this beauty because words cannot even begin to describe it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/nvidia-shieldtv/docker-on-nvidia-shieldtv.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Alright, start breathing again.</p>

<p>It is called the <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com">Nvidia ShieldTV</a> and it&rsquo;s meant to be a media center.
Besides, it is one of the first Android gaming consoles that actually is worthy of the name.</p>

<p>It would be a really great Christmas present for my son. But that is purely hypothetical and he is totally out of luck here.</p>

<p>Why? Well, because the Nvidia Tegra X1 CPU is one of the first <strong>64-bit ARM CPU&rsquo;s</strong> that can be bought <strong>now</strong> and it is even <strong>affordable</strong> with a price tag well under 200 bucks.</p>

<p>Being both Dieter and part of the Hypriot crew it should be clear now where this is heading, right?
As you all know Docker pirates love to be ARMed with little explosive stuff - and it doesn&rsquo;t get more explosive than the Nvidia ShieldTV.</p>

<p>So my son won&rsquo;t get to play any games soon because <strong>I need</strong> to get Docker running on this little beauty.
A device engineered for performance and made to game. So, let&rsquo;s start playing&hellip;</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 8, 2015</span>

        <p>Today we wanna share something with you that we have been working on for the last couple of weeks. And we are pretty exited about it, too.
It is based on our beloved <a href="/post/get-your-all-in-one-docker-playground-now-hypriotos-reloaded/">HypriotOS</a> and makes it dead simple to build Docker clusters.</p>

<p>Until now it was not exactly easy to get started with Docker clustering.
You would have needed specific knowledge and lots of time to manually configure the cluster and its individual nodes.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s now a thing of the past.</p>

<p>May we introduce to you the newest member of the Hypriot family: <strong>The Hypriot Cluster Lab!</strong></p>

We are really happy that we were able to finish our new release called &ldquo;Hector&rdquo; just in time for DockerCon EU.</p>

<p>If you like a personal demo of what&rsquo;s in store for &ldquo;Hector&rdquo; just ping @Quintus23M on Twitter and meet him in person at DockerCon EU.
Dieter and Andreas brought their treasure chest filled with Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s to Barcelona and are eager to show off a bit.</p>

        <p>The great ARMed flood has begun. Especially for the sake of the IoT, every day new tiny devices pop up all around the world. And since most of these devices are build on top of the ARM architecture, with each new device, ARM gets more important compared to the x86 architecture proposed by Intel/AMD. Maybe you even need to run your next app on ARM! Thus better be prepared and port apps to ARM, it&rsquo;s basically just one step to take.</p>

There are even <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">whole projects</a> dedicated to giving an overview of the most popular static site generators.</p>

<p>One of the first static site generators that got really popular was <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/commits/master">Jekyll</a>, which was conceived by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> of Github fame.
Typically static site generators transform input (e.g. text in a lightweight markup language such as Markdown or reStructuredText) to static HTML with the help of templates and filters.</p>

        <p>Hypriot had a short demo session (16:45 - 17:15 PDT) on the second day of the DockerCon 2015 in San Francisco,CA (USA).
The goal of the demo was to show that Docker is a really lightweight &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; solution that can be easily run on small IoT devices.</p>

        <p>The last couple of days Mathias Renner and I were busy creating a comprehensive <a href="/getting-started">Getting Started guide for Docker on the Raspberry Pi</a>.
Our goal was to give users easy to understand step by step instructions on how to get Docker running on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

        <p>After nearly two months of development Docker 1.6.0 was finally released into the wild.
Being right on the heels of the Docker team we were able to create an ARM compatible version within minutes and of course you can download it here as a Debian package.</p>

        <p>In this blog post we gonna walk you through the different steps that are necessary to get you started with Docker Compose and show how to use it.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the benefits of Docker Compose we are going to create a simple Node.js &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application which will run on three Docker Node.js containers.
HTTP requests will be distributed to these Node.js nodes by an HAProxy instance running on another Docker container.</p>

        <p>Time is running and it is nearly a month since we released our last ARM Docker SD card image for the Raspberry Pi.
Listening to our users and having some ideas of our own we are back again with our latest version of HypriotOS.</p>

<p>We dubbed it &ldquo;<strong>Jack</strong>&rdquo; as every proper software release should have a fitting <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/05/27/the-developer-obsession-with-code-names-114-interesting-examples/">code name</a>.</p>

        <p>Nearly two weeks ago we have been blown away by the positive feedback we got for <a href="/kick-ass-raspberry-pi-2-having-a-forbidden-love-affair-with-docker-1-dot-4-1">our first Raspberry Pi SD card image</a>. It allowed people to get up and running with Docker on the Raspberry Pi in no time.</p>

<p>The positive feedback we received and the fact that two days later Docker 1.5.0 was released did motivate us to create an improved version of our Get-Docker-Up-And-Running-On-Your-Pi-In-No-Time SD card image.</p>

        If you have not been living under a rock last week you probably heard that the Raspberry Pi Foundation did release a second generation Raspberry Pi on the 2th of February. The last generation being a huge success with 4 million devices sold at the end of 2014 the success story is likely to continue with a new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B in 2015. Pi 2 has the same form factor as the previous Pi 1 Model B+ and is completely compatible with Pi 1 - which is good news for everybody who already owns a Pi 1.
